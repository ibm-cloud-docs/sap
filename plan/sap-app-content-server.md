# SAP Content Server
{: #content-server}

The SAP Content Server is a stand-alone component for storing large quantities of electronic documents in any format and with any content. This component can cache the content from several locations the business operates in which reduces network load. To use the SAP Content Server, your SAP applications must support its use.

The SAP Content Server uses the SAP MaxDB database and one of the following operating systems:
* Windows Server
* SUSE Linux&reg;
* Red Hat Linux

For more information about these supported operating systems releases, see the [SAP Product Availability Matrix (PAM)](https://support.sap.com/en/release-upgrade-maintenance.html#section_1969201630){: external}.

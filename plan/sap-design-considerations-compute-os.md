# Compute and OS design considerations
{: #compute-os-design-considerations}

The SAP systems in a landscape have specific requirements for servers, operating systems, network setup, and supported storage.
{: shortdesc}

In some regards, SAP workloads that use a cloud service provider (such as {{site.data.keyword.ibm_cloud_sap}}) Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) is similar to existing practices over many decades for running SAP workloads by using an external data center or data center provider. An SAP landscape has specific requirements for connectivity, between hosts within a cloud environment and to external systems. {{site.data.keyword.ibm_cloud_sap}} provides a rich set of functions beyond hosting of SAP systems to improve your SAP landscape.

The [SAP-certified IaaS offerings](/docs/sap?topic=sap-iaas-offerings) provide different compute options and variations of capabilities and sizing for SAP workloads. They are available on {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} in many {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} data centers around the world.
See the current data centers in [IBM Cloud regions](/docs/power-iaas?topic=power-iaas-ibm-cloud-reg).

To assist your project's planning phase, the following sections provide {{site.data.keyword.ibm_cloud_sap}} portfolio design considerations for **Compute and OS**.


## Compute Performance considerations
{: #compute}

The {{site.data.keyword.ibm_cloud_sap}} portfolio is ideal for practically all SAP use case scenarios. You can use your servers for mission-critical workloads, as your test environment, or your business continuity disaster recovery (BCDR) site.

### SAP Application Server work processes scheduling and scaling
{: #compute-workprocesses}


CPU thread consumption affects the following processes.

* Dialog Work Process
* Update Work Process
* Background Work Process
* Enqueue Work Process
* Spool Work Process


### Compute Profiles of SAP-certified Bare Metal on Classic Infrastructure
{: #compute-baremetal-classic}

You are offered SAP-certified servers, which have various pre-configured combinations of the amount of RAM and number of CPUs.

For SAP HANA workloads, these combinations represent the [**appliance** delivery model](https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_HANA_PLATFORM/eb3777d5495d46c5b2fa773206bbfb46/e2ebe79cf9a248ee9dda83cef123863f.html){: external} of SAP HANA hardware certification. Except, that {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} does not pre-install SAP HANA platform. Therefore, the characteristics of the server (amount of RAM and disks) cannot be changed during the ordering process or through a support ticket after servers are deployed.

Servers that are intended for SAP Application Server based workloads, the configuration is more flexible, i.e. you may add or remove disks as you like.

### Compute Profiles of SAP-certified VMware on Classic Infrastructure
{: #compute-vmware}

VMware runs on the same SAP-certified Bare Metals. Therefore, the VMware vSphere (ESXi) installation on the certified hardware enables the VMware-SAP certification and agreements to be valid. Therefore, all VMware-SAP certification guidance must be followed (as described in SAP Notes for VMware-SAP).
{: note}

VMware SDDC is available as a customer-controlled root-access hypervisor, which is certified to run SAP workloads. Providing VMware SDDC does not automatically provide a pre-sized virtual machine for SAP HANA or SAP Application Server upon provisioning either the OS image with VMware vSphere (ESXi) for the Bare Metal or the fully automated setup from {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} for VMware Solutions Dedicated. You choose how to size and configure your SAP Workloads (for SAP HANA, size and configuration is under the SAP HANA TDI delivery model).

When you run SAP workloads on VMware, you have significant flexibility and the full capabilities which VMware built to run SAP workloads over decades is available to use.

Using VMware for SAP workloads on {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} is certified, by using the "TDI" delivery model for which you would need to run validation checks to gain SAP Support.

However, VMware SDDC is a Type 2 hypervisor and therefore does have a small overhead of CPU/RAM that is used for running ESXi on the Bare Metal server. This CPU/RAM overhead is then available for virtual machines to use. On average this overhead is 10%, and is expected by VMware-SAP in virtualized environments. Therefore, customers are encouraged to size correctly and test performance before you go live [SAP Note 2393917 - SAP HANA on VMware vSphere 6.5 and 6.7 in production](https://me.sap.com/notes/0002393917){: external}.

Also, both VMware and SAP agree to the physical to virtual overhead of <10% on average, and provide:
- The estimation of <10% average overhead with equation `"physical SAPS - 10%"` for virtualized SAPS to use when you size virtual machines
- The estimation of `"between 0.5% and 3%"` subtracted from total available physical RAM. Although, _"the actual RAM overhead can be defined only after the VMs are configured"_

## Operating Systems considerations
{: #os}

The {{site.data.keyword.ibm_cloud_sap}} portfolio provides various Operating Systems for the Enterprise IT organization to select from.


### Operating Systems supported
{: #os-supported}

You need to consult [SAP Note 2414097](https://me.sap.com/notes/2414097){: external} for a list of guest operating systems (OS) to deploy SAP HANA and SAP Application Server-based systems. An SAP S-user ID is required to access the SAP Note.

For the Operating System, the SAP HANA certified servers are available with the following operating systems:
* Red Hat Enterprise Linux for SAP HANA
* SUSE Linux Enterprise Server for SAP HANA
* VMware vSphere hypervisor (ESXi) + created Guest OS with RHEL/SLES

For the Operating System, the SAP Application Server certified servers are available with the following operating systems:
* IBM AIX (only on IBM {{site.data.keyword.powerSys_notm}})
* Red Hat Enterprise Linux for SAP Applications
* SUSE Linux Enterprise Server for SAP Applications
* VMware vSphere hypervisor (ESXi) + created Guest OS with RHEL/SLES/WinS
* Windows Server

For SAP HANA release versions (including SPS and Revision and Patch numbers), support is only available for pre-defined and specific major.minor releases of an Operating System (for example, RHEL 7.6). This information is shown in [SAP 2235581 - SAP HANA: Supported Operating Systems](https://me.sap.com/notes/2235581){: external}. An example is available in the SAP Note attachment `SAP_HANA_OS_Release_Support_Matrix.pdf`.

For SAP Application Server release versions, support is available for each major release of an Operating System (for example, SLES 12) meaning each subsequent release is available for use (example: SLES 12 SPS4, SLES 12 SP5, and so on). This information is shown in the [SAP Product Availability Matrix (PAM)](https://support.sap.com/en/release-upgrade-maintenance.html#section_1969201630){: external}.


### OS configuration for SAP
{: #os-configuration}

Each infrastructure has various operating systems with various images for those operating systems available on-demand.

Each of these on-demand OS images (for example, RHEL 7.6 for SAP HANA) is provided as shipped (also known as the "general availability" / "stock image" release) by each of the vendors (for example, Red Hat). These OS images are provided with access from the OS Package Manager (for example, RHEL4SAP, which is `yum`) to the OS package update channels specific to the OS Packages for SAP. The OS package update channels permit updates to the OS according to the latest SAP Notes for the relevant Operating System with the specified OS kernel versions, OS package versions, and OS package for SAP versions that are required.

Therefore, for OS images, you need to perform the following actions.
- OS configuration according to SAP guidance.
- OS package updates according to SAP guidance, which includes updates to specified OS kernel versions (for example, RHEL4SAP 7.6 ships with `3.10.0-957.el7.x86_64`. However, SAP requires the 1.3 version `3.10.0-957.1.3.el7.x86_64`).

### OS for Virtual Servers on VPC Infrastructure
{: #os-vs-vpc}

For a list of operating systems and databases available for SAP Application Server-based system deployments, see [SAP Note 2927211](https://me.sap.com/notes/2927211){: external}.

An SAP S-user ID is required to access the SAP Note.

### OS when you use VMware SDDC
{: #os-vmware}

VMware SDDC is available as a customer-controlled root-access hypervisor, which is available as an OS image for the Bare Metal or available with fully automated setup from {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} for VMware Solutions Dedicated. The VMware licensing can be included or BYOL.

However, when you run a VMware SDDC, the Virtual Machine's Guest OS licensing and subscriptions (to the relevant package update channels, including OS Packages for SAP) is covered by you.

Only the following operating systems are supported as guest Operating Systems for VMware SDDC and SAP workloads.

* Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) for SAP
* SUSE Linux Enterprise Server for SAP
* Microsoft Windows Server

You need to make sure that the SAP HANA Tailored Data Center Integration (TDI) Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) are met for every virtual machine on which SAP HANA is deployed.

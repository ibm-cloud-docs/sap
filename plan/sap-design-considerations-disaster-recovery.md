# Planning Disaster Recovery for SAP solutions on IBM Cloud
{: #disaster-recovery-design-considerations-overview}

Disaster Recovery (DR) is a strategic plan that helps organizations respond to unplanned events such as natural disasters, power outages, cyber attacks, and other disruptive events.
The primary goal of a DR plan is to minimize the impact of such disruptions and enable the organization to continue or quickly resume critical operations.
A well-structured DR plan facilitates rapid recovery, regardless of the cause of the disruption, to mitigate potential revenue loss, brand damage, and customer dissatisfaction.

This document outlines the design and implementation of a disaster recovery strategy for organizations that run SAP systems in the IBM Cloud.
- The first step is to assess business needs, including identifying critical data, determine Recovery Time Objectives (RTOs), and set Recovery Point Objectives (RPOs).
- Step two focuses on designing the disaster recovery strategy.
   This step includes consideration of data replication methods, backup locations, and failover and failback procedures.
- The next step is implementation by using IBM Cloud services such as IBM Virtual Private Cloud (VPC), IBM {{site.data.keyword.powerSys_notm}}, and IBM Cloud Object Storage.
   These services facilitate automation, scalability, and improved redundancy.
- Step four covers network and security configurations, focusing on VPCs, VPNs, direct links, access controls, and encryption.
- Extensive documentation and regular testing (step five) and ongoing monitoring and maintenance (step six) are critical for the effectiveness and relevance of the disaster recovery plan.

## Assessing your business needs
{: #disaster-recovery-design-considerations-business-needs}

It is important to understand your business needs before you get into the technical details of a disaster recovery plan.
Analyze which of your data, applications, and information are essential and identify the critical systems.
Each application has its own RTO (Recovery Time Objective) and RPO (Recovery Point Objective) requirements, which can be expressed in the form of service classes or tiers.

### Defining resiliency tiers
{: #disaster-recovery-design-considerations-resiliency-tiers}

Categorize your applications into resiliency tiers based on their RTO and RPO requirements.

The following list is an example of a resiliency tier categorization.
- Tier 1: Continuous Availability (RTO <= 1 hour, RPO <= 1 hour)
- Tier 2: Advanced Recovery (> 1 hour - <= 24 hours, RPO < 2 hours - <= 24 hours)
- Tier 3: Standard Recovery (> 24 hours - <= 72 hours, RPO: Last Backup)
- Tier 4: No Recovery (Not applicable)
## Designing your disaster recovery strategy for IBM Cloud
{: #disaster-recovery-design-considerations-strategy}

The next step after a thorough assessment is to design a disaster recovery strategy for the IBM Cloud that meets your business needs.
Consider the following components.

### Data replication
{: #disaster-recovery-design-considerations-data-replication}

Select the appropriate data replication method (asynchronous or synchronous) based on your RTOs and RPOs.
- The database layer of the SAP system can provide data replication by using technologies such as SAP HANA System Replication, IBM Db2 HADR, Oracle Data Guard.
- [Global Replication Services (GRS)](/docs/power-iaas?topic=power-iaas-getting-started-GRS) in IBM {{site.data.keyword.powerSys_notm}} provides asynchronous replication and advanced network configuration for fast data transfer to geographically dispersed locations.
- [File share replication](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-file-storage-replication&interface=ui) in IBM Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) creates a replica for your file share.
   With the File Share Replication feature, you create a read-only copy of your file share in another zone or region in the same geography.

### Backup and restore
{: #disaster-recovery-design-considerations-backup}

Perform regular backups of critical data and systems and make sure that they are stored in a secure and accessible location.
Backups must be aligned with disaster recovery obligations and tested regularly to ensure completeness and successful execution.

### Failover and failback
{: #disaster-recovery-design-considerations-failover}

Plan for automated failover to a secondary site in the event of a disaster.
Establish procedures for returning back to the primary site after the disaster is resolved.

Implementing automated failover and failback in DR plans is essential to minimize downtime, ensure efficiency, maintain consistency, scale to complex environments, optimize resource allocation, facilitate testing, reduce costs, and improve overall resiliency.

## Implementing your Disaster Recovery strategy in IBM Cloud
{: #disaster-recovery-design-considerations-implement}

Build your DR plan based on the robust infrastructure and services in the IBM Cloud.
Consider the following key services.

### IBM Virtual Private Cloud
{: #disaster-recovery-design-considerations-implement-vpc}

You can create a snapshot for a file share in VPC.
A snapshot is a point-in-time copy of your file share data that is tied directly to the lifecycle of the file share.
See [Planning File Storage for VPC snapshots](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-fs-snapshots-planning&interface=ui).

### IBM {{site.data.keyword.powerSys_notm}}
{: #disaster-recovery-design-considerations-implement-pvs}

Deploy virtual servers in multiple regions to increase redundancy and availability.
Use [Global Replication Services (GRS)](/docs/power-iaas?topic=power-iaas-getting-started-GRS) for asynchronous block storage replication.

### IBM Cloud Object Storage

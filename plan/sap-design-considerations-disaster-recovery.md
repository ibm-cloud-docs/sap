# Planning Disaster Recovery for SAP solutions on IBM Cloud
{: #disaster-recovery-design-considerations-overview}

Disaster Recovery (DR) is a strategic plan that helps organizations respond to unplanned events such as natural disasters, power outages, cyberattacks, and other disruptive events.
The primary goal of a DR plan is to minimize the impact of such disruptions and enable the organization to continue or quickly resume critical operations.
A well-structured DR plan provides quick recovery, independent of the cause of the disruption to reduce potential revenue loss, brand damage, and customer dissatisfaction.

Design and implement a disaster recovery strategy for organizations that run SAP systems in the IBM Cloud by completing the following steps:

1. Assess your business needs by including processes to identify critical data, determine Recovery Time Objectives (RTO), and set Recovery Point Objectives (RPOs).
1. Design the disaster recovery strategy by including the data replication methods, backup locations, and failover and failback procedures.
1. Implement the disaster recovery strategy by using IBM Cloud services such as IBM Virtual Private Cloud (VPC), IBM Power Virtual Servers, and IBM Cloud Object Storage. These services facilitate automation, scalability, and enhanced redundancy.
1. Configure the network and security settings focusing on VPCs, VPNs, direct links, access controls, and encryption.
1. Ensure that you regularly test, monitor, and maintain your disaster recovery plan to ensure its effectiveness and relevance.

## Assessing your business needs
{: #disaster-recovery-design-considerations-business-needs}

Understand your business needs before you design the DR strategy.
Analyze the required data, applications, and information.
Identify the critical systems of your business.
Each application has specific RTO and RPO requirements, which are described as service classes or tiers.

### Defining resiliency tiers
{: #disaster-recovery-design-considerations-resiliency-tiers}

Categorize your applications to resiliency tiers based on their RTO and RPO requirements.

The following list is an example of how you can classify a resiliency tier:
- Tier 1: Continuous availability (RTO <= 1 hour and RPO <= 1 hour)
- Tier 2: Advanced recovery (> 1 hour to <= 24 hours and RPO < 2 hours to <= 24 hours)
- Tier 3: Standard recovery (> 24 hours to <= 72 hours and RPO: Last Backup)
- Tier 4: No recovery (Not applicable)

## Designing your disaster recovery strategy for IBM Cloud
{: #disaster-recovery-design-considerations-strategy}

After you thoroughly assess your business needs, design a DR strategy that meets your needs.
Consider the following operations:

### Data replication
{: #disaster-recovery-design-considerations-data-replication}

Select one of the following data replication methods according to your RTOs and RPOs:

- SAP HANA System Replication, IBM Db2 HADR, or Oracle Data Guard, which uses the database layer of the SAP system for data replication.
- [Global Replication Services (GRS)](/docs/power-iaas?topic=power-iaas-getting-started-GRS) in IBM {{site.data.keyword.powerSys_notm}} that provides an asynchronous replication and advanced network configuration for quick data transfer to distant locations.
- [File share replication](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-file-storage-replication&interface=ui) in IBM Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) that creates replicas of your file shares in another zone in the same geography. With the File Share Replication feature, you can keep a read-only copy of your file share in a different zone. If you have another VPC in the target region, you can also create a replica in another region in the same location.

### Backup and restore
{: #disaster-recovery-design-considerations-backup}

Perform regular backups of critical data and systems and make sure that they are stored in a secure and accessible location.
Backups must be aligned with disaster recovery obligations and tested regularly to ensure completeness and successful execution.

### Failover and failback
{: #disaster-recovery-design-considerations-failover}

Plan for an automated failover to a secondary site during a disaster.
Set up procedures for restoring data to the primary site after the disaster is resolved.

An automated failover and failback procedure in DR plans offers the following benefits:
- Minimizes downtime
- Ensures efficiency
- Maintains consistency
- Scales to complex environments
- Optimizes resource allocation
- Facilitates testing
- Reduces costs
- Improves the overall resiliency

## Implementing your Disaster Recovery strategy in IBM Cloud
{: #disaster-recovery-design-considerations-implement}

Build your DR plan based on the infrastructure and services in the IBM Cloud.
Consider the following key services.

### IBM Virtual Private Cloud
{: #disaster-recovery-design-considerations-implement-vpc}

Create a snapshot for a file share in VPC.
A snapshot is an instant copy of your file share that is mapped to the lifecycle of the file share.
For more information, see [Planning File Storage for VPC snapshots](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-fs-snapshots-planning&interface=ui).

### IBM {{site.data.keyword.powerSys_notm}}
{: #disaster-recovery-design-considerations-implement-pvs}

Deploy virtual servers in multiple regions to increase redundancy and availability.
Use [Global Replication Services (GRS)](/docs/power-iaas?topic=power-iaas-getting-started-GRS) for asynchronous block storage replication.

### IBM Cloud Object Storage
{: #disaster-recovery-design-considerations-implement-cos}

Use IBM Cloud Object Storage, a scalable and cost-effective solution, to store backups and replicated data.
The IBM Cloud Object Storage provides features such as resiliency, durability, geographic redundancy, support for incremental backups, data separation, and staging.

### Cobalt Iron - Secure Automated Backup
{: #disaster-recovery-design-considerations-implement-cobalt-iron}

Create backups across multiple environments by using Cobalt Iron, which provides a secure, automated, and cost-effective solution.
It includes centralized management of the backup policies, advanced compliance features, and disaster recovery support.

For more details about backup strategies in IBM {{site.data.keyword.powerSys_notm}}, see [Secure automated backup with Compass for AIX and Linux](/docs/power-iaas?topic=power-iaas-backup-strategies#baas).

## Configuring networking and security
{: #disaster-recovery-design-considerations-implement-network-security}

Create network and security measures to protect data from unauthorized access, theft, or corruption during transmission and storage.
These measures are important in a disaster recovery scenario in which data might be transferred between the primary and secondary sites or stored in the cloud.
Use encryption, access controls, and secure protocols to maintain data confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
Verify that your DR plan includes an efficient network and security configuration.
Consider the following key services:

### Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)
{: #disaster-recovery-design-considerations-implement-network-security-vpc}

Create isolated networks for a disaster recovery environment with IBM Cloud VPC.
It provides logical isolation, custom networking policies, multi-region coverage, high-speed networking, and support for core services.

### VPN and Direct Link
{: #disaster-recovery-design-considerations-implement-network-security-direct-link}

Use VPN or Direct Link to establish secure connections between your on-premises infrastructure and IBM Cloud.

### Access Controls and Encryption
{: #disaster-recovery-design-considerations-implement-network-security-access-control}

Implement strict access controls and encrypt data in transit and at rest.

## Documenting and testing your Disaster Recovery plan
{: #disaster-recovery-design-considerations-test-dr-plan}

Document your disaster recovery plans and make them available to business units and operations.
Test recovery plans regularly to verify whether they restore the necessary services and networks with minimal impact.
Consider the following actions:

### Defining roles and responsibilities
{: #disaster-recovery-design-considerations-roles-and-responsibilities}

Define roles and responsibilities in a DR plan.
A defined DR plan reduces confusion and improves response times as tasks are identified.
In addition, a clearly defined DR plan provides the following benefits:
- Avoids duplication of effort and considers the complete recovery process
- Facilitates effective communication and coordination among team members
- Promotes accountability by ensuring that each role has an assigned owner responsible for execution

### Staff training
{: #disaster-recovery-design-considerations-training}

Ensure that your IT staff is trained on the latest disaster recovery procedures and tools.
Training ensures that all team members understand their roles during a disaster.
This clarity is mandatory for a coordinated response and minimizes confusion when an incident occurs.
Regular training helps staff familiarize with the DR procedures and reduce the chance of errors during execution.
This familiarity significantly speeds up the recovery process, minimizes downtime, and prevents the adverse impact on business operations.

### Arranging for disaster recovery drills
{: #disaster-recovery-design-considerations-test-dr-drills}

Conduct regular disaster recovery trainings to simulate disaster scenarios and validate your failover and failback procedures.
Include the following disaster recovery exercises in the DR plan to minimize downtime and contribute to an effective DR strategy:
- Test the plan.
- Train personnel
- Identify and resolve issues
- Verify compliance
- Document lessons learned

### Performance testing
{: #disaster-recovery-design-considerations-test-dr-performance}

Demonstrate the effectiveness of the DR plan to assure the stakeholders that your organization can recover from disruptions and maintain business continuity.
Test the DR environment performance regularly for the following reasons:
- Verify that the DR infrastructure manages the required workload and recovers in the defined Recovery Time Objective (RTO). It determines that critical applications and services are restored quickly and minimizes the downtime and its associated costs.
- Identify possible limitations in the DR environment, allowing for necessary adjustments and optimizations before a real disaster occurs. A proactive approach can prevent unexpected issues during an actual recovery.
- Provide observability about the actual recovery time and data loss. In-depth observability improves the RPO and aligns the DR environment with your organization's risk tolerance.


### Compliance audits
{: #disaster-recovery-design-considerations-dr-compliance-audits}

Review your DR plan regularly to be compliant with industry regulations and standards.
Many industries have regulatory requirements for disaster recovery planning and staff training.

## Continuous monitoring and improvement of the DR plan
{: #disaster-recovery-design-considerations-plan-updates}

Update the disaster recovery plan regularly based on lessons that are learned from incidents, tests, identified risks, and changes in recovery objectives and priorities.
The updates must reflect changes in business operations, infrastructure, and technology.

### Monitoring tools
{: #disaster-recovery-design-considerations-monitoring-tools}

Use IBM Cloud monitoring tools to track the health and performance of your DR environment.
Monitoring tools provide observability to the DR infrastructure to quickly identify and respond to issues.
The tools also help to identify possible obstructions or limitations in the DR environment to make adjustments and optimizations before an actual disaster.

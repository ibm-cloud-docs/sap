# SAP NetWeaver 7.x with SAP ASE database on DR configuration
{: #sap-ase-db-intro}

The IBM Cloud® architecture provides superior technical capabilities such as a software-definable environment critical to a cloud infrastructure, programmable interfaces, hundreds of hardware, and network configurations. It is designed to deliver a higher level of flexibility by mixing virtual and dedicated servers to fit various workloads, automation of interfaces, and hybrid deployment options. The IBM Cloud SAP-Certified Infrastructure offering provides you with a best-fit selection of bare metal and virtualization-based servers on which the SAP software stack is run.

SAP ASE database is one of several databases that can be deployed on SAP NetWeaver in the IBM Cloud. IBM Cloud is certified for running SAP NetWeaver application servers like ABAP, Java, and SAP products based on these application server stacks.

The following reference architecture describes a possible implementation of a DR configuration in IBM Cloud VPC, considering SAP NetWeaver Application Servers with SAP ASE database workloads running on Virtual Server Instances across two regions.

![Figure 1.

Deployment of SAP system in a Disaster Recovery scenario is based on two system deployments in two separate IBM Cloud VPC regions, which are geographically distant:

1. Installation/deployment is designated as a primary site on which all transaction processing takes place (Primary Active).
2. Installation/deployment designated as a Secondary site (Secondary stand-by) which contains a copy of the databases from the primary server.

The following SAP technical components are deployed in this configuration:

* **SAP ASE database** - there are two installations on two VSIs and in 2 regions with asynchronous replication configuration support.
* **SAP ASCS, Central Services, and PAS** - the Primary Application server with dialog and batch processing.
* **SAP Router (optional)** - provides secured connections to the VSI and remote connections for support of the SAP AG remote services.

IBM Cloud VPC services and components in support of SAP Disaster Recovery configuration:

* **Network Services (VPN, Public Gateway)** - provides user access and internet connectivity.
* **Jumphost** - used to access, manage, and administer SAP VSI from the respective user zone, directly from their premises.
* **Transit Gateway** - a service, which connects two VPCs from 2 regions and assures network connectivity between the private networks.
* **DNS Service** - this is a global service, which permits connectivity on virtual names for SAP and ASE instances.

Clients on the Customer Facing Network (CFN) use a VPN service or a Floating IP address to access VSIs within the IBM Cloud. Virtual server instances are hosted in availability zones (data centers) within the geographic regions.

The SAP virtual server instances can be in a separate security zone. The user connection to the jumphost follows the same rules as the direct connection from user premises to the virtual server instance SAP instances. The connection uses the Floating IP and security group 1 firewall rules from a designated public subnet. In this architecture, there are two security groups that are defined in every region; this arrangement is the simplest method for separating the public and private subnets. You can add more security groups if you require more isolation. The security groups rules must be customized in order to permit database and application connectivity between regions.

Storage can be local disks, or can be attached as File Shares. What is important here is that due to the nature of DB and application replication scenarios, no filesystems are shared between the sites.

## Key aspects
{: #key-aspects-ase}

From the DR perspective, the purpose of separating the SAP application server and the ASE database host, meaning using a distributed installation mode is to permit some functionalities of the application server even if the database host is unavailable. The two VSIs can be installed separately in two zones in the same region.

In the same time, the goal of this Disaster Recovery configuration is to maintain business continuity during a disaster, which brings down an entire site or region.

Due to the possible high network latency generated by the distant database connection, and in order to avoid any performance impact on the primary site, data replication can only run in asynchronous mode.

SAP ASE database and the SAP Replication Server run on the same host in both regions. Also, the primary replication server runs and commits transactions without waiting for acknowledgments from the stand-by/secondary replication server.

![Figure 1. ASE database](../../images/vpc-intel-vsi-arch-diagram-ase.svg "ASE database"){: caption="ASE database" caption-side="bottom"}

There is also a data replication mechanism for the SAP application servers files, implemented by a “rsync” script. All application files that are generated on the primary site will be available on the stand-by site. More, the secondary site application server is a mirror installation of the primary one and must be kept offline when the primary site is active.

When the ASE database failover take places (the primary site is down and unusable) then a manual procedure and the new primary database is manually promoted. In this situation, there would be some data loss as some of the data will be stuck in the queue and not replicated to the stand-by site. When failover is run, no action must be taken regarding the file replication of the SAP application servers as this is synchronous due to “rsync” executable.

After a failover, the roles of the systems are reversed. That means, the DNS must be updated in order to bring up to date the virtual hosts name resolution. ASE virtual host and SAP Application virtual host will now point to the systems hosted in the secondary site, and now they have taken the primary role. When the manual failover is completed, users and related applications can reconnect to the same virtual host. As some DB data could be lost, the application investigation must be performed and some data must be re-created.

Bringing up again the former primary site can allow to setup a new replication configuration, the former primary can be now configured as the Stand-by site. In order to achieve this, the former primary database must be rematerialized and replication restarted.

# VPC with Additional Application Server (AAS) ABAP on Linux for SAP HANA
{: #automate-hana-aas-anydb-terraform-ansible}

You can use Terraform scripts to create a single-tier VPC and create the AAS to HANA and AnyDB infrastructure on the VPC. The Terraform scripts use the VPC information that you provide and then call the Ansible playbook to create the SAP architecture on the specified VPC. Terraform on {{site.data.keyword.cloud}} enables predictable and consistent provisioning of {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) infrastructure resources so that you can rapidly build complex, cloud environments. {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} VPC infrastructure consists of SAP certified hardware that uses Intel&reg; Xeon CPUs and more Intel&reg; technologies.

You have two deployment methods to choose from:

*  Terraform scripts that run from the CLI on your bastion server.
* {{site.data.keyword.bpshort}} user interface accessed from your cloud dashboard menu.

You can create SAP AAS NetWeaver 7.x on the SAP HANA-based ABAP stack.

## SAP solution implemented
{: #ui-automate-hana-aas-anydb-solution}
{: ui}

Many SAP enterprise solutions are built on the SAP platform (SAP NetWeaver) including:

*  SAP HANA as Primary Persistence for SAP NetWeaver-based applications
*  SAP Business Suite applications (ERP, CRM, and SCM, and other applications),
*  SAP Business Warehouse (BW), and
*  Other SAP enterprise solutions

SAP NetWeaver has two distinct aspects, ABAP and Java. Many applications that are built on the SAP NetWeaver’s ABAP or Java (or both) application servers run on SAP DB owned HANA and ASE Sybase either in AnyDB platforms (MSSQL, Oracle, and Db2).

Technical interfaces are available for applications that are built on the SAP NetWeaver AS ABAP and AS Java to run on SAP HANA and AnyDB. However, specific development enablement is normally required for each application to ensure that it runs optimally on the SAP HANA. SAP Business Suite applications (ERP, CRM, SCM, and other applications), SAP Business Warehouse (BW), and other SAP NetWeaver-based applications were modified to run on SAP HANA and have many advantages. Also, various components and complimentary applications that are built on SAP NetWeaver can also run on SAP HANA or AnyDB by using the provided SAP NetWeaver DB interfaces.

The SAP HANA as primary persistence for SAP NetWeaver-based applications scenario has one restriction:
SAP NetWeaver ABAP and Java application servers must run on separate hardware servers from the SAP HANA hardware.

## What is created
{: #ui-automate-hana-aas-anydb-what-created}
{: ui}

The scripts automate the virtual infrastructure resources, provisioning the processes for the SAP architecture in an existing VPC with a distributed environment. SAP AAS NetWeaver 7.x (HANA or ASE SYB) application server on a distinct VSI VPC system and SAP HANA DB on a dedicated server type VSI VPC box are provisioned. The scripts work in two phases.

During the first phase of [Automate SAP bastion server – SAP media storage repository](/docs/sap?topic=sap-sap-bastion-server), the following virtual infrastructure resources based on the components from the existing VPC created by the bastion server are:
*  1 VPC where the virtual server instance is provisioned.
*  1 security group. The rules for this security group are:
    *  Allow inbound DNS traffic (port 53).
    *  Allow inbound SSH traffic (TCP port 22).
    *  Allow all outbound traffic from the virtual server instance.
    *  Allow all traffic in the security group.
*  1 subnet to enable the networking in your VPC.
*  2 virtual server instances with SAP certified storage and network configurations.
*  1 floating IP address used to access your VPC virtual server instance over the public network.

During the second phase, the Ansible Playbooks is called and the SAP architecture is installed for both dedicated virtual server instance (VSI) SAP application; VSI system and dedicated SAP HANA VSI box. The SAP architecture that is deployed on the SAP NetWeaver 7.x release is a stand-alone dedicated SAP HANA 2.0 box release. For more information about this architecture, see [Automating SAP HANA stand-alone virtual server instance on {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}® VPC by using Terraform and Ansible](/docs/sap?topic=sap-automate-terraform-sap-hana-vsi).

You can provision only one instance of the service per {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} region.

## Schematics deployment
{: #ui-automate-hana-aas-anydb-schematics-deployment}
{: ui}

When you run the scripts with the {{site.data.keyword.bpshort}} interface, you:

*  Enter the workspace information.
*  Enter the GitHub path for the chosen solution either on NetWeaver AAS for HANA.
*  Modify the parameters in the {{site.data.keyword.bpshort}} interface. They are the same parameters as the `input.auto.tfvars` file that you use with the cli.

## Virtual server instance configuration
{: #ui-automate-hana-aas-anydb-virtual-config}
{: #ui}

Following are the supported operating system images for SAP NetWeaver primary application server:

*  ibm-redhat-8-4-amd64-sap-applications-2
*  ibm-redhat-8-6-amd64-sap-applications-2
*  ibm-sles-15-3-amd64-sap-applications-2
*  ibm-sles-15-4-amd64-sap-applications-3

Following are the supported operating system images for SAP HANA database:

*  ibm-redhat-8-4-amd64-sap-hana-2
*  ibm-redhat-8-6-amd64-sap-hana-2
*  ibm-sles-15-3-amd64-sap-hana-2
*  ibm-sles-15-4-amd64-sap-hana-1

For both server instances there are:

*   Two SSH keys are configured to access SSH as `root`.
*   Three storage volumes as described in the `input.auto.tfvars` file.

## What is created for anydb
{: #automate-hana-aas-anydb-what-created}
{: terraform}

The scripts use the information that you provide for an existing VPC and deploy AAS to SAP HANA or AnyDB on a different host than CI (SAP Central Instance) VSI host. For more information about this architecture, see [SAP NetWeaver 7.x on UNIX with HANA or AnyDB on {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} VPC on {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} VPC](/docs/sap?topic=sap-sap-refarch-nw-sybase). You specify the information for the VPC to use in the `input.auto.tfvars` file.

The scripts call the Ansible Playbooks to install the SAP architecture.

## Script files
{: #automate-hana-aas-anydb-script-files}

The configuration and script files are provided on GitHub. Each supported interface for the SAP solution installation has its own folder in the GitHub repository:

*   [GitHub repository for Terraform – AAS HANA](https://github.com/IBM-Cloud/sap-abap-hana-aas){: external}

## Terraform interface
{: #automate-hana-aas-anydb-terraform-interface}
{: terraform}

To run the Terraform script, you modify:

* The `input.auto.tfvars` file to specify the existing VPC resources for your solution. Specify the variables for the existing VPC:

    *   VPC name
    *   Security group
    *   Subnet
    *   Hostname
    *   Profile
    *   Image
    *   Up to two SSH keys

    You can change the default SAP system configuration settings to match your solution. You can also specify the location where you downloaded the SAP kits.

The {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Provider plug-in for Terraform on {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} uses these configuration files to install AAS to SAP HANA and AnyDB on the specified VPC in your {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} account.

## Before you begin
{: #automate-hana-aas-anydb-before}

Before you use the scripts in the bastion cli:

* Set up your account to access the VPC. Make sure that your account is [upgraded to a paid account](/docs/account?topic=account-accountfaqs#changeacct).
* If you have not already, create a Bastion server to store the SAP kits. For more information, see [Automate SAP bastion server - SAP media storage repository](/docs/sap?topic=sap-sap-bastion-server).
* Download the SAP kits from the SAP Portal to your Deployment Server. Make note of the download locations. Ansible decompresses the files. For more information, see the [readme](https://github.com/IBM-Cloud/sap-abap-hana-aas#readme){: external} file.
* [Create or retrieve an {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} API key](/docs/account?topic=account-userapikey&interface=ui#create_user_key). The API key is used to authenticate with the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} platform and to determine your permissions for {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} services.
* [Create or retrieve your SSH key ID](/docs/ssh-keys?topic=ssh-keys-getting-started-tutorial). You need the 40-digit UUID for the SSH key, not the SSH key name.
* Terraform should already be installed on the bastion server that you deployed. For more information, see [Bastion server for SAP deployment](/docs/sap?topic=sap-sap-bastion-server).
* (Optional - Catalog Tile) create secrets for your credentials and passwords by using the [Secrets Manager](/docs/secrets-manager?topic=secrets-manager-arbitrary-secrets&interface=ui).

## Creating the infrastructure using Terraform with the bastion server CLI
{: #automate-hana-aas-anydb-create-terraform}
{: terraform}

Use these steps to configure the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Provider plug-in and use Terraform to install SAP AAS to SAP HANA and AnyDB on your existing VPC on an already deployed SAP NetWeaver 7.X with SAP HANA 2.0 or ASE SYB as a Central Instance.

The script takes 1 - 2 hours to complete.

1. Access the bastion server cli.
2. Clone the solution repository and change to the folder.

    ASE SYB 16
    Clone the solution repository from https://github.com/IBM-Cloud/sap-aas-abap-ase-syb and cd to the sap-aas-abap-ase-syb/cli folder.

    ```shell
    git clone https://github.com/IBM-Cloud/sap-aas-abap-ase-syb
    cd sap-aas-abap-ase-syb/cli/

    ```

    SAP HANA 2.0:
    Clone the solution repository from https://github.com/IBM-Cloud/sap-abap-hana-aas and cd to the sap-abap-hana-aas folder.

    ```shell
    git clone https://github.com/IBM-Cloud/sap-abap-hana-aas.git
    cd sap-abap-hana-aas/
    ```

3. Modify the `input.auto.tfvars` file to specify the information for the existing VPC, your region, zone, networking component names, hostname for the AAS VSI,profile, and image. You need your 40-digit SSH key ID for this file. The second SSH key is optional. For more options for profile, see [Instance Profiles](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-profiles). For more options, see [Images](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-about-images). For descriptions of the variables, see the [readme](https://github.com/IBM-Cloud/sap-abap-hana-aas#readme){: external} file.

    The VSI OS images that are supported for this solution for Netweaver Additional Application Server are:

    *   ibm-redhat-8-4-amd64-sap-applications-2
    *   ibm-redhat-8-6-amd64-sap-applications-2
    *   ibm-sles-15-3-amd64-sap-applications-2
    *   ibm-sles-15-4-amd64-sap-applications-4


    ```terraform

    HOSTNAME = "sapnwapp"
    PROFILE = "bx2-4x16"
    IMAGE = "ibm-redhat-8-6-amd64-sap-applications-2"
    ```

4. Customize your SAP system configuration. In the same file, input.auto.tfvars, edit the SAP system configuration variables that are passed to the Ansible automated deployment. For descriptions of the variables, see the [readme](https://github.com/IBM-Cloud/sap-abap-hana-aas#readme){: external} file.

    ```terraform
    # SAP system configuration - for ASE SYB
    sap_sid = "NWD"
    sap_ci_host = "10.243.132.10"
    sap_ci_hostname = "sapnwase"
    sap_ci_instance_number = "00"
    sap_ascs_instance_number = "01"
    sap_aas_instance_number = "00"

    # Kits paths
    kit_sapcar_file = "/storage/NW75SYB/SAPCAR_1010-70006178.EXE"
    kit_swpm_file = "/storage/NW75SYB/SWPM10SP31_7-20009701.SAR"
    kit_saphotagent_file = "/storage/NW75SYB/SAPHOSTAGENT51_51-20009394.SAR"
    ```

    ```terraform
    # SAP system configuration - for ABAP HANA
    sap_sid = "NWD"
    sap_ci_host = "10.243.132.10"
    sap_ci_hostname = "sapnwapp01"
    sap_ci_instance_number = "00"
    sap_ascs_instance_number = "01"
    hdb_instance_number = "00"
    sap_aas_instance_number = "00"

    # Kits paths
    kit_sapcar_file = "/storage/NW75HDB/SAPCAR_1010-70006178.EXE"
    kit_swpm_file = "/storage/NW75HDB/SWPM10SP31_7-20009701.SAR"
    kit_saphotagent_file = "/storage/NW75HDB/SAPHOSTAGENT51_51-20009394.SAR"
    kit_hdbclient_file = "/storage/NW75HDB/IMDB_CLIENT20_009_28-80002082.SAR"
    ```

    Ansible decompresses the rest of the SAP kit files. For more information, see the [readme](https://github.com/IBM-Cloud/sap-abap-hana-aas#readme){: external} file.

5. Initialize the Terraform CLI.

    `terraform init`

6. Create a Terraform execution plan. The Terraform execution plan summarizes all the actions that are done to create the virtual private cloud instance in your account.

    `terraform plan plan1`

    Enter an SAP main password and your API key.

    The SAP main password must be 10 - 14 characters long and contain at least one digit (0-9). It can contain only the following characters: a-z, A-Z, 0-9, @, #, $, _. This password cannot contain exclamation points '!'. The password must not start with a digit or an underscore (_).

7. Verify that the plan shows all of the resources that you want to create and that the names and values are correct. If the plan needs to be adjusted, edit the input.auto.tfvars file to correct resources and run terraform plan again.

8. Apply the saved plan.

    ```terraform
    terraform apply "plan1"
    ```

 The virtual private cloud and components are created and you see output similar to the `terraform plan` output.

9. Add the SAP credentials and the virtual server instance IP to the SAP GUI. For more information about the SAP GUI, see [SAP GUI](https://help.sap.com/doc/7abd5470728810148a4b1a83b0e91070/1511%20000/en-US/frameset.htm){: external}.

## Next steps
{: #automate-hana-aas-anydb-next}
{: terraform}

If you need to rename your resources after they are created, modify the input.auto.tfvars file to change the names and run `terraform plan` and `terraform apply` again. Do not use the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Dashboard and user interface to modify your VPC after it is created. The Terraform scripts create a complete solution and selectively modifying resources with the user interface might cause unexpected results.

If you need to remove the SAP Netweaver 7.X on HANA or AnyDB installation, go to your project folder and run `terraform destroy`. The `terraform destroy` command does not remove the VPC in this scenario because the VPC was created before these Terraform scripts were run.

# Configuring SAP HANA Multitarget System Replication in a RHEL HA Add-On Cluster
{: #ha-rhel-hana-sr-multitarget}

The following information describes the configuration of a Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) HA add-on cluster for managing *SAP HANA&reg system replication* in a multitarget replication scenario.
The cluster uses virtual server instances in [{{site.data.keyword.powerSysFull}}](https://www.ibm.com/products/power-virtual-server){: external} as cluster nodes.

You can connect multiple systems in an SAP HANA multitarget system replication topology to achieve a higher level of availability.
A third SAP HANA instance runs on a virtual server instance in IBM {{site.data.keyword.powerSys_notm}} in another workspace.
The resource agents for SAP HANA in the Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 (RHEL) HA add-on require that the third SAP HANA instance is managed manually and is installed on a virtual server instance outside the cluster.
{: shortdesc}

In a *multitarget system replication* scenario, one secondary SAP HANA system runs on a virtual server instance in the cluster and another secondary HANA system runs on a virtual server instance that is deployed in a *Disaster Recovery (DR) site*.
The *DR site* is implemented in a different IBM {{site.data.keyword.powerSys_notm}} workspace in another geographical location or zone.
The SAP HANA system replication operation mode must be identical for all multitarget replication levels.

A takeover of the secondary system in the *DR site* must be triggered manually.

This information is intended for architects and specialists that are planning a high-availability deployment of SAP HANA on {{site.data.keyword.powerSys_notm}}.
{: note}

## Before you begin
{: #ha-rhel-hana-sr-mtgt-begin}

Review the general requirements, product documentation, support articles, and SAP notes listed in [Implementing High Availability for SAP Applications on IBM {{site.data.keyword.powerSys_notm}} References](/docs/sap?topic=sap-ha-rhel-refs).

## Prerequisites
{: #ha-rhel-hana-sr-mtgt-prerequisites}

- A Red Hat High Availability cluster is deployed on two virtual server instances in one workspace in {{site.data.keyword.powerSys_notm}}.
   Follow the instructions in the following documents.
   - [Implementing a RHEL HA Add-On Cluster on IBM {{site.data.keyword.powerSys_notm}}](/docs/sap?topic=sap-ha-rhel).
   - [Configuring SAP HANA Scale-Up System Replication in a RHEL HA Add-On Cluster](/docs/sap?topic=sap-ha-rhel-hana-sr).
- A third virtual server instance is deployed in another workspace in {{site.data.keyword.powerSys_notm}}.
- SAP HANA is installed on the third virtual server instance with the same `SID` and `Instance Number`.
- Optional - you can reserve a virtual IP address for the system on NODE3 as described in [Reserving virtual IP addresses](/docs/sap?topic=sap-ha-vsi#ha-vsi-reserve-virtual-ip-addresses).
   Assigning and unassigning this virtual IP address on NODE3 is a manual task and not part of a cluster operation.

## Setting up a multitarget scenario
{: #ha-rhel-hana-sr-mtgt-setup}

A multitarget scenario is an extension of the setup that is described in [Configuring SAP HANA Scale-Up System Replication in a RHEL HA Add-On Cluster](/docs/sap?topic=sap-ha-rhel-hana-sr).
Make sure that you complete the setup for the system replication cluster before you continue with the following steps.

To simplify the cluster operations, you can set the `AUTOMATED_REGISTER` cluster attribute of the `SAPHana` resource to `true`.
With `AUTOMATED_REGISTER=true`, the cluster performs an automatic registration of the previous primary as a new secondary after the failed node reappears in the cluster.

On a cluster node, run the following command to verify the `AUTOMATED_REGISTER` cluster attribute of the resource.

```sh
pcs resource config SAPHana_${SID}_${INSTNO}
```
{: pre}

Sample output:
```sh
# pcs resource config SAPHana_${SID}_${INSTNO}
 Resource: SAPHana_HDB_00 (class=ocf provider=heartbeat type=SAPHana)
  Attributes: AUTOMATED_REGISTER=true DUPLICATE_PRIMARY_TIMEOUT=900 InstanceNumber=00 PREFER_SITE_TAKEOVER=True SID=HDB
  Operations: demote interval=0s timeout=3600 (SAPHana_HDB_00-demote-interval-0s)
              methods interval=0s timeout=5 (SAPHana_HDB_00-methods-interval-0s)
              monitor interval=121 role=Slave timeout=700 (SAPHana_HDB_00-monitor-interval-121)
              monitor interval=119 role=Master timeout=700 (SAPHana_HDB_00-monitor-interval-119)
              promote interval=0s timeout=3600 (SAPHana_HDB_00-promote-interval-0s)
              reload interval=0s timeout=5 (SAPHana_HDB_00-reload-interval-0s)
              start interval=0s timeout=3600 (SAPHana_HDB_00-start-interval-0s)
              stop interval=0s timeout=3600 (SAPHana_HDB_00-stop-interval-0s)
```
{: screen}

If the `AUTOMATED_REGISTER` cluster attribute is currently set to `false`, use the following command to enable the automatic registration.

```sh
pcs resource update SAPHana_${SID}_${INSTNO} AUTOMATED_REGISTER=true
```
{: pre}

### Providing network connectivity between the workspaces
{: #ha-rhel-hana-sr-mtgt-conn}

1. Use the information in [Creating the workspace](/docs/sap?topic=sap-ha-vsi#ha-vsi-create-workspace) to create another workspace in a different geographic location or region.
1. Create subnets and make sure that the IP ranges don't overlap with any subnet of the workspace that hosts the virtual server instances for the cluster. For more information, see [Creating private network subnets](/docs/sap?topic=sap-ha-vsi#ha-vsi-create-subnets).
1. Set up {{site.data.keyword.cloud}} connections up in both workspaces and activate *Enable IBM Transit Gateway*. For more information, see [Creating Power Virtual Server Cloud Connections](/docs/power-iaas?topic=power-iaas-cloud-connections#create-cloud-connections).
1. Deploy an {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Transit Gateway to interconnect the two IBM {{site.data.keyword.powerSys_notm}} workspaces.

   {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Transit Gateway enables the interconnection of IBM {{site.data.keyword.powerSys_notm}}, {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} classic, and Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) infrastructures and keeps data within the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} networks. For more information about planning and deploying {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Transit Gateway, see [Planning for {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Transit Gateway](/docs/transit-gateway?topic=transit-gateway-helpful-tips) and [Ordering {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Transit Gateway](/docs/transit-gateway?topic=transit-gateway-ordering-transit-gateway).
   {: note}

1. To add the connections to your transit gateway to establish network connectivity between your IBM {{site.data.keyword.powerSys_notm}}, open the [Transit Gateway](https://cloud.ibm.com/interconnectivity/transit){: external} page.
1. Select the name of your transit gateway.
1. Click **Add connection**.
1. Choose **Power Systems Virtual Serverk** as network connection, and select the **Location** of your workspace.
1. Click **Add** to create a connection.

### Preparing environment variables on NODE3
{: #ha-rhel-hana-sr-mtgt-env}

To simplify the setup, prepare the following environment variables for user ID `root` on NODE3.
These environment variables are used in subsequent commands in the remainder of the instructions.

On NODE3, create a file with the following environment variables.
Then, adapt the variables according to the configuration of your SAP HANA system.

```sh
export SID=<SID>            # SAP HANA System ID (uppercase)
export sid=<sid>            # SAP HANA System ID (lowercase)
export INSTNO=<INSTNO>      # SAP HANA Instance Number

export DC3=<Site3>          # HANA System Replication Site Name 3

export NODE1=<Hostname 1>   # Hostname of virtual server instance 1 (production primary)
export NODE2=<Hostname 2>   # Hostname of virtual server instance 2 (production secondary)
export NODE3=<Hostname 3>   # Hostname of virtual server instance 3 (production tertiary)
```
{: codeblock}

You must source this file before you can use the sample commands in the remainder of this document.

For example, if you created a file that is named `sap_dr_site.sh`, run the following command on NODE3 to set the environment variables.

```sh
source sap_dr_site.sh
```
{: pre}

Every time that you start a new terminal session, you must run the previous `source` command.
Alternatively, you can move the environment variables file to the `/etc/profile.d` directory for the duration of the cluster configuration.
In this example, the file is sourced automatically each time you log in to the server.
{: important}

### Verifying network connectivity between the virtual server instances
{: #ha-rhel-hana-sr-mtgt-verify-conn}

Verify the network connectivity between the two cluster nodes (NODE1 and NODE2) and NODE3.

1. Log in to both NODE1 and NODE2, and `ping` NODE3.

   ```sh
   ping -c 3 ${NODE3}
   ```
   {: pre}

   Sample output:
   ```sh

### Copying PKI SSFS storage certificate files to NODE3
{: #ha-rhel-hana-sr-mtgt-ssfs}

The SAP HANA 2.0 data and log transmission channels for the replication process require authentication by using the system *PKI SSFS* storage certificate files.
- [2369981 - Required configuration steps for authentication with HANA System Replication](https://me.sap.com/notes/2369981){: external})

The system *PKI SSFS* storage certificate files are stored in `/usr/sap/${SID}/SYS/global/security/rsecssfs/` in subdirectories `data` and `key`.

On NODE3, run the following commands to copy files `SSFS_${SID}.DAT` and `SSFS_${SID}.KEY` from NODE1.

```sh
scp ${NODE1}:/usr/sap/${SID}/SYS/global/security/rsecssfs/data/SSFS_${SID}.DAT /usr/sap/${SID}/SYS/global/security/rsecssfs/data/SSFS_${SID}.DAT
```
{: pre}

```sh
scp ${NODE1}:/usr/sap/${SID}/SYS/global/security/rsecssfs/key/SSFS_${SID}.KEY /usr/sap/${SID}/SYS/global/security/rsecssfs/key/SSFS_${SID}.KEY
```
{: pre}

The copied *PKI SSFS* storage certificates on NODE3 become active during the start of the SAP HANA system.
Therefore, it is recommended to copy the files when the SAP HANA system on NODE3 is stopped.

### Registering NODE3 as a secondary SAP HANA DR system replication system
{: #ha-rhel-hana-sr-mtgt-tier2}

Register the SAP HANA system as a secondary DR system replication instance.

1. On NODE3, stop the SAP HANA system.

   ```sh
   sudo -i -u ${sid}adm -- HDB stop
   ```
   {: pre}

1. On NODE3, register the secondary SAP HANA instance with NODE1.

   ```sh
   sudo -i -u ${sid}adm -- \
       hdbnsutil -sr_register \
         --name=${DC3} \
         --remoteHost=${NODE1} \
         --remoteInstance=${INSTNO} \
         --replicationMode=async \
         --operationMode=logreplay \
         --online
   ```
   {: pre}

1. On NODE3, start the secondary SAP HANA instance.

   ```sh
   sudo -i -u ${sid}adm -- HDB start
   ```
   {: pre}

### Checking the SAP HANA system replication status
{: #ha-rhel-hana-sr-mtgt-check-sr-status}

You can monitor the system replication status by using the following tools.

- *SAP HANA cockpit*
- *SAP HANA studio*
- `hdbnsutil` command-line tool
- `systemReplicationStatus.py` Python script
- SQL queries

The full output of the `systemReplicationStatus.py` script is available on only the primary system, as a database connection is required to obtain some of the status information.

On NODE1, check the system replication status by using the `systemReplicationStatus.py` Python script.

```sh
sudo -i -u ${sid}adm -- HDBSettings.sh systemReplicationStatus.py
```
{: pre}

Sample output:

```sh
# sudo -i -u ${sid}adm -- HDBSettings.sh systemReplicationStatus.py

## Enabling automatic registration of secondaries after a takeover
{: #ha-rhel-hana-sr-mtgt-enable-auto-registration}

In multitarget replication scenarios, SAP HANA can automatically reregister the secondaries that were previously registered before a takeover.
To enable this feature, set the parameter `register_secondaries_on_takeover` in the `[system_replication]` section in the `global.ini` file to `true`.
After a failover of an SAP HANA primary system to a secondary, the other secondary system reregisters automatically to the new primary system.

This option must be added to the `global.ini` file on all potential primary sites.

On all three nodes, run the following command to change the parameter.

```sh
sudo -i -u ${sid}adm -- <<EOT
    python \$DIR_INSTANCE/exe/python_support/setParameter.py \
      -set SYSTEM/global.ini/system_replication/register_secondaries_on_takeover=true
EOT
```
{: pre}

Verify the `[system_replication]` section in the `global.ini` configuration file.

```sh
cat /hana/shared/${SID}/global/hdb/custom/config/global.ini
```

#### Test1 - Test procedure
{: #ha-rhel-hana-sr-mtgt-test1-procedure}

Crash SAP HANA primary by sending a SIGKILL signal as user `${sid}adm`.

On NODE1, run the following command.

```sh
sudo -i -u ${sid}adm -- HDB kill-9
```
{: pre}

#### Test1 - Expected behavior
{: #ha-rhel-hana-sr-mtgt-test1-expected-behavior}

- The SAP HANA primary instance on NODE1 crashes.
- The cluster detects the stopped primary and marks the resource as `undefined`.
- The cluster promotes the secondary SAP HANA system on NODE2, which takes over as primary.
- The cluster releases the virtual IP address on NODE1, and acquires it on the primary on NODE2.
- If an application, such as SAP NetWeaver, is connected to a tenant database of SAP HANA, the application automatically reconnects to the new primary.
- The secondary HANA system that runs on NODE3 at the *DR site* is automatically reregistered to the new primary that runs on NODE2.
- The cluster waits until the primary on NODE2 is fully active and registers the failed instance on NODE1 as a secondary.
- The cluster starts the secondary HANA instance on NODE1.

On NODE1, run the following command to check the cluster status.

```sh
pcs status --full
```
{: pre}

mode: PRIMARY
site id: 2
site name: SiteB
```
{: screen}

The SAP HANA primary runs on NODE2 at `SiteB`.
The secondary on NODE3 is automatically reregistered to the new primary that runs on NODE2.
As the cluster resource `SAPHana_${SID}_${INSTNO}` is configured with `AUTOMATED_REGISTER=true`, the cluster registers the SAP HANA system on NODE1 automatically as a secondary to the primary on NODE2.

### Test2 - Testing the manual move of a SAPHana resource to another node
{: #ha-rhel-hana-sr-mtgt-test2-manual-move}

Use the following information to test the manual move of the SAPHana resource to another node.

#### Test2 - Description
{: #ha-rhel-hana-sr-mtgt-test2-description}

Use cluster commands to move the primary instance to the other cluster node.

#### Test2 - Prerequisites
{: #ha-rhel-hana-sr-mtgt-test2-prerequisites}

- A functional two-node RHEL HA Add-On cluster for HANA system replication.
- Both cluster nodes are active.
- The cluster is started on NODE1 and NODE2.
- The cluster resource `SAPHana_${SID}_${INSTNO}` is configured with `AUTOMATED_REGISTER=true`.
- Check SAP HANA system replication status:
   - HANA system replication is activated and in sync.
   - The primary SAP HANA system runs on NODE2.
   - The secondary SAP HANA system runs on NODE1.
   - Another secondary SAP HANA system runs on NODE3 at the *DR site* and is registered with NODE2.

#### Test2 - Test procedure
{: #ha-rhel-hana-sr-mtgt-test2-procedure}

1. On a cluster node, run the following command to move the primary back to NODE1.

   ```sh
   pcs resource move SAPHana_${SID}_${INSTNO}-clone
   ```
   {: pre}

   Sample output:

   ```sh
   # pcs resource move SAPHana_${SID}_${INSTNO}-clone
   Warning: Creating location constraint 'cli-ban-SAPHana_HDB_00-clone-on-cl-hdb-2' with a score of -INFINITY for resource SAPHana_HDB_00-clone on cl-hdb-2.
        This will prevent SAPHana_HDB_00-clone from running on cl-hdb-2 until the constraint is removed
        This will be the case even if cl-hdb-2 is the last node in the cluster
   ```
   {: screen}

   After the primary is active on NODE1, SAP HANA automatically reregisters the instance on NODE3 as a secondary to NODE1.

1. Wait until the primary is up on NODE1.
   Then, remove the location constraint.

   ```sh
   pcs resource clear SAPHana_${SID}_${INSTNO}-clone
   ```
   {: pre}

   Sample output:
   ```sh
   # pcs resource clear SAPHana_${SID}_${INSTNO}-clone
   Removing constraint: cli-ban-SAPHana_HDB_00-clone-on-cl-hdb-2
   ```
   {: screen}

   This command clears the location constraint that was created by the move command.
   The cluster starts the SAP HANA system on NODE2.

1. Verify the system replication status on all three nodes as described in [Checking the SAP HANA system replication status](#ha-rhel-hana-sr-mtgt-check-sr-status).

#### Test2 - Expected behavior
{: #ha-rhel-hana-sr-mtgt-test2-expected-behavior}

- The cluster creates a location constraint to move the resource.
- The cluster triggers a takeover to the secondary HANA system on NODE1.
- If an application, such as SAP NetWeaver, is connected to a tenant database of SAP HANA, the application automatically reconnects to the new primary.
- Register NODE2 with the primary on NODE1.
- Run `pcs resource clear` command to remove the location constraint.
   This command triggers the start of the secondary instance on NODE2.
- The secondary HANA system that runs on NODE3 at the *DR site* is automatically reregistered to the new primary that runs on NODE1.

#### Test2 - Recovery procedure
{: #ha-rhel-hana-sr-mtgt-test2-recovery-procedure}

No recovery procedure is required.
The test sequence reestablished the initial SAP HANA multitarget system replication topology.

### Test3 - Testing failure of node that runs the primary database
{: #ha-rhel-hana-sr-mtgt-test3-primary-instance-server-failure}

Use the following information to test the failure of the node that runs the primary database.

#### Test3 - Description
{: #ha-rhel-hana-sr-mtgt-test3-description}

Simulate a crash of the node that runs the primary HANA database.

#### Test3 - Prerequisites
{: #ha-rhel-hana-sr-mtgt-test3-prerequisites}

- A functional two-node RHEL HA Add-On cluster for HANA system replication.
- Both cluster nodes are active.
- The cluster is started on NODE1 and NODE2.
- The cluster resource `SAPHana_${SID}_${INSTNO}` is configured with `AUTOMATED_REGISTER=true`.
- Check SAP HANA system replication status:
   - HANA system replication is activated and in sync.
   - The primary SAP HANA system runs on NODE1.
   - The secondary SAP HANA system runs on NODE2.
   - Another secondary SAP HANA system runs on NODE3 at the *DR site* and is registered with NODE1.

#### Test3 - Test procedure
{: #ha-rhel-hana-sr-mtgt-test3-procedure}

Crash the primary on NODE1 by sending a *crash* system request.

On NODE1, run the following command.

```sh
sync; echo c > /proc/sysrq-trigger
```
{: pre}

#### Test3 - Expected behavior
{: #ha-rhel-hana-sr-mtgt-test3-expected-behavior}

- NODE1 crashes.
- The cluster detects the failed node and sets its state to `OFFLINE`.
- The cluster promotes the secondary HANA database on NODE2 to take over as the new primary.
- The cluster acquires the virtual IP address on NODE2.
- If an application, such as SAP NetWeaver, is connected to a tenant database of SAP HANA, the application automatically reconnects to the new primary.
- The secondary SAP HANA system that runs on NODE3 at the *DR site* is automatically reregistered to NODE2.

Verify the SAP HANA system replication status on NODE2.

1. Run the steps in [Test2 - Test the manual move of SAP Hana resource to another node](#ha-rhel-hana-sr-mtgt-test2-manual-move) to revert to the initial topology.

### Test4 - Testing DR activation on the node that runs at the DR site
{: #ha-rhel-hana-sr-mtgt-test5-dr-drill}

Use the following information to test the failure of both nodes in the primary workspace.

#### Test4 - Description
{: #ha-rhel-hana-sr-mtgt-test5-description}

Simulate a crash of the nodes that run the primary and secondary SAP HANA databases.

#### Test4 - Prerequisites
{: #ha-rhel-hana-sr-mtgt-test5-prerequisites}

- A functional two-node RHEL HA Add-On cluster for HANA system replication.
- Both cluster nodes are active.
- The cluster is started on NODE1 and NODE2.
- The cluster resource `SAPHana_${SID}_${INSTNO}` is configured with `AUTOMATED_REGISTER=true`.
- Check SAP HANA system replication status:
   - SAP HANA multitarget system replication is activated and in sync.
   - The primary SAP HANA system runs on NODE1.
   - The secondary SAP HANA system runs on NODE2.
   - Another secondary SAP HANA system runs on NODE3 at the *DR site* and is registered with NODE1.

#### Test4 - Test procedure
{: #ha-rhel-hana-sr-mtgt-test5-procedure}

Crash primary on NODE1 and secondary on NODE2 by sending a *crash* system request on both nodes.

1. On NODE1, run the following command.

   ```sh
   sync; echo c > /proc/sysrq-trigger
   ```
   {: pre}

1. On NODE2, run the following command.

   ```sh
   sync; echo c > /proc/sysrq-trigger
   ```
   {: pre}

1. On NODE3, run the following command to activate the HANA system as primary.

   ```sh
   sudo -i -u ${sid}adm -- hdbnsutil -sr_takeover
   ```
   {: pre}

   Sample output:

   ```sh
   # sudo -i -u hdbadm -- hdbnsutil -sr_takeover
   done.
   ```
   {: screen}

#### Test4 - Expected behavior
{: #ha-rhel-hana-sr-mtgt-test5-expected-behavior}

- NODE1 and NODE2 halt immediately.
- After the manual takeover, NODE3 runs the primary SAP HANA system.
- An application, such as SAP NetWeaver, can connect to the SAP HANA system on NODE3.

NODE3 is not part of the cluster and does not takeover the virtual IP address after a HANA system replication takeover.
The start up of application servers that connect to NODE3 at the *DR site* requires extra effort, which is not described in this document.
{: important}

On NODE3, run the following command to verify that the SAP HANA system runs as primary.

```sh
sudo -i -u ${sid}adm -- hdbnsutil -sr_state
```
{: pre}

Sample output:

```sh
# sudo -i -u hdbadm -- hdbnsutil -sr_state

#### Test5 - Description
{: #ha-rhel-hana-sr-mtgt-test6-description}

Restore the original system replication topology and reactivate the cluster in the primary workspace.

#### Test5 - Prerequisites
{: #ha-rhel-hana-sr-mtgt-test6-prerequisites}

- A two-node RHEL HA Add-On cluster for HANA system replication in the primary workspace.
- Both virtual server instances of the cluster are stopped.
- The primary SAP HANA system runs on NODE3 at the *DR site*.

#### Test5 - Test procedure
{: #ha-rhel-hana-sr-mtgt-test6-procedure}

1. Restart virtual server instances in the primary workspace.

   1. Log in to the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} console and start both NODE1 and NODE2.
   1. Wait until both nodes are available.
   1. Make sure that the Red Hat HA Add-On cluster services are stopped on both cluster nodes.

1. Register the SAP HANA system on NODE1 as a secondary.

   1. On NODE3, verify that SAP HANA system replication is enabled.

      ```sh
      sudo -i -u ${sid}adm -- hdbnsutil -sr_state

1. Initiate a fallback to the primary workspace.

   You need a downtime window to perform the move of the primary role back to NODE1.
   {: important}

   To optimize the downtime window, the SAP HANA system on NODE2 can be registered as secondary to NODE3 now before the downtime window.
   The drawback is that a higher amount of data is transferred between the two {{site.data.keyword.powerSys_notm}} workspaces.

   In the following, the SAP HANA system on NODE2 is registered as secondary to NODE1 after NODE1 becomes primary again.

   1. Stop all applications and SAP application servers that are connected to NODE3.

   1. On NODE1, run the following command to takeover the primary role.

      A *takeover with handshake* suspends all transactions on the primary system on NODE3 and the takeover is only executed when all remaining redo log is available on NODE1.

      ```sh
      sudo -i -u ${sid}adm -- hdbnsutil -sr_takeover --suspendPrimary
      ```
      {: pre}

   1. On NODE1, check that the HANA system runs as primary.

      ```sh
      sudo -i -u ${sid}adm -- hdbnsutil -sr_state

      In case the system does not automatically restart after the `hdbnsutil -sr_register` command, you need to stop and start it manually.

      The following is a sample output of such a situation.
      The replication status of NODE3 shows `IS PRIMARY (e.g. after takeover)` and it does not change when you check the status multiple times.

      ```sh
      # sudo -i -u ${sid}adm -- HDBSettings.sh systemReplicationStatus.py

      On NODE3, run the following command to restart the secondary HANA system.

      ```sh
      sudo -i -u ${sid}adm -- HDB restart
      ```
      {: pre}

   The following summary shows the final status after these steps.

   - NODE1 runs as primary.
   - NODE2 runs as secondary.
   - NODE3 runs as another secondary at the *DR site*.
   - NODE2 and NODE3 are both registered to NODE1.
   - Red Hat HA Add-On cluster services are started and the cluster manages SAP HANA system replication on NODE1 and NODE2.

   On NODE1, run the following command to verify the SAP HANA system replication topology.

   ```sh
   sudo -i -u ${sid}adm -- HDBSettings.sh systemReplicationStatus.py
   ```
   {: pre}

   Sample output:

   ```sh
   # sudo -i -u hdbadm -- HDBSettings.sh systemReplicationStatus.py

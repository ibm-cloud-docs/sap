# Deploying SAP workload S/4HANA HA deployment on {{site.data.keyword.cloud}} VPC (Terraform and Ansible)
{: #automate-s4hana-ha-terraform-ansible}

Terraform on {{site.data.keyword.cloud}} enables predictable and consistent provisioning of {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) infrastructure resources so that you can rapidly build complex cloud environments. {{site.data.keyword.vpc_short}} infrastructure consists of SAP certified hardware that uses Intel&reg; Xeon CPUs and other Intel&reg; technologies.

Terraform scripts are used to create a VPC and 2 clustered layers, one for SAP S/4HANA and another for SAP HANA in-memory database in a HA Single and Multi Zone architecture on the bastion server. Creating the bastion server is a prerequisite for all IBM SAP VPC automated solutions. The automation scripts use the VPC information that you provide and then call the Ansible playbook to create the SAP architecture on the specified VPC.
{: shortdesc}

You have three deployment methods to choose from:

*   Terraform scripts run from the CLI on your bastion server.
*   Catalog tile user interfaced from the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} catalog.
*   {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} {{site.data.keyword.bpshort}} user interface accessed from the menu on your cloud dashboard.

## SAP solution implemented
{: #automate-s4hana-ha-sz-implemented}

SAP S/4HANA is an ERP system from SAP's ERP software product line. The software is based on the innovative SAP HANA database technology and was started as the fourth product generation in 2015. Users can choose between the SAP S/4HANA Cloud and on-premises solution.

An ERP system is used for demand-oriented business resource planning. It is used to control processes and to link departments and functional areas in a meaningful way. Individual modules include applications for accounting, sales, production, and marketing. More complex tasks in customer or supply chain management can also be done by ERP software. As the successor to the core product SAP ECC, SAP S/4HANA was presented as the intelligent ERP system of the new generation. With the help of modern technologies, the Software as Service (SaaS) version is designed to help companies standardize processes and make the leap to digitalization.

While previous SAP ERP solutions support the most common databases, SAP S/4HANA uses exclusively the SAP HANA in-memory database developed by SAP. This in-memory database offers users the greatest technical benefit and they benefit from increased performance. The "S" in S/4HANA stands for "simple", while the "4" refers to the generation sequence. Compared to the SAP core product SAP ECC, which is still used in most companies, SAP S/4HANA offers many innovative functions that revolutionize the system landscape from the ground up. As SAP plans to discontinue the mainstream maintenance of its existing ERP solutions by 2027, many SAP ECC users are already considering a migration to SAP HA SZ or MZ S/4HANA.

## What is created
{: #automate-s4hana-ha-what-is-created}

The scripts work in two phases. The first phase automates creating the resources for the VPC provisioning process in an existing VPC created when you deploy the bastion VSI. The second phase creates the SAP architecture in a distributed environment.

1. Architecture for S/4HANA HA in a single zone
    * SAP HA SZ S/4HANA App cluster server on a distinct VSI as a single zone VPC
    * SAP HANA cluster DB on a dedicated server type VSI as a single zone VPC

2. Architecture for S/4HANA HA in a multi-zone
    * SAP HA MZ S/4HANA App cluster server on a distinct VSI as multi-zone VPC
    * SAP HANA cluster DB on a dedicated server type VSI as multi-zone VPC

It is recommended to read the guidelines from the readme file when deploying this solution.
{: note}

For more information about this architecture, see [SAP NetWeaver 7.x with SAP HANA {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} VPC](/docs/sap?topic=sap-sap-refarch-nw-hana&interface=ui).

During the first phase, the following resources are provisioned in the VPC:
*    1 Power Placement group for all 4 virtual machines created by this solution
*    4 VSIs, with Subnet and Security Group configurations
*    3 Application Load Balancers for HANA DB and SAP ASCS/ERS
*    1 VPC DNS service used to map the ALB FQDN to the SAP ASCS/ERS and HANA virtual hostnames
*    7 file shares for VPC

During the second phase, the Ansible Playbooks are called and the SAP High availability architecture is installed for both dedicated VSIs SAP App VSI box and dedicated SAP HANA VSI box. The SAP architecture that is deployed is the SAP S/4HANA release on the pacemaker cluster. HA dedicated SAP HANA 2.0 VSI’s release as a distributed deployment model. For more information about this architecture, see [Automating SAP HANA stand-alone virtual server instance on {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} VPC by using Terraform and Ansible](/docs/sap?topic=sap-automate-terraform-sap-hana-vsi).

## Highly available system for SAP S/4HANA in a Single zone or Multi zone architectures
{: #automate-s4hana-ha-for-hana-db}

![Figure 1. SAP HA for SAP applications cluster nodes PAS (Active) and AAS (Active) Schematics deployment (Single Zone architecture)](images/sap-hana-ha-sz-sap-layer.svg "SAP HA for SAP applications cluster nodes PAS (Active) and AAS (Active) Schematics deployment (Single Zone architecture)"){: caption="SAP HA for SAP applications cluster nodes PAS (Active) and AAS (Active) Schematics deployment (Single Zone architecture)" caption-side="bottom"}

![Figure 2. SAP HA for HANA DB instances cluster nodes primary (Active) and Secondary (Passive) (Single Zone architecture)](images/sap-ha-hana-vpc-single-zone.svg "SAP HA for HANA DB instances cluster nodes primary (Active) and Secondary (Passive) (Single Zone architecture)"){: caption="SAP HA for HANA DB instances cluster nodes primary (Active) and Secondary (Passive) (Single Zone architecture)" caption-side="bottom"}

At the most basic level, a standard HA HANA cluster in an active-passive configuration has two nodes: one is the primary node and the other is the standby node. The primary node is actively serving the active SAP instances (PAS and AAS), while the standby node is waiting to jump in if necessary.

The cluster is set with a virtual hostname IP. Hostname is mapped to the FQDN of the HANA ALB through DNS, which is the same as SAP ASCS and ERS instances. App instances (PAS and AAS), are the details to be used on the SAP profiles to call that particular component. The cluster assigns that virtual IP to the active node and uses a heartbeat monitor to confirm the availability of the components. If the primary node stops responding, it triggers the automatic failover mechanism that calls the standby node to become the primary node. The ALB detects the change, redirects the traffic to the new active node, and assigns the virtual IP to it, restoring the component availability. After the failed node is fixed, it comes online as a standby node.

## Terraform scripts
{: #automate-terraform-hana-ha-sz-contents}
{: terraform}

The Terraform scripts included for deploying are:

* One Power Placement group to include all the four VMs involved in this solution.
* Four VSIs in an existing VPC with subnet and security group configurations. The VSIs scope: two for the HANA database cluster instance and two for the SAP application cluster.
* Configuring three Application Load Balancers like HANA DB and SAP ASCS/ERS.
* Configuring one VPC DNS service that is used to map the ALB FQDN to the SAP ASCS/ERS and HANA virtual hostnames.
* Configuring seven file shares for VPC.

The Ansible scripts that are included for deploying are:

* OS requirements installation and configuration for SAP applications.
* Cluster components installation
* Ansible scripts for SAP application cluster configuration and SAP HANA cluster configuration.
* HANA installation
* HANA DB backup
* HANA system replica configuration
* ASCS and ERS instances installation
* DB load
* Primary and extra application server installation

For CLI deployment, Ansible is started by Terraform and both must be available on the same host (bastion server).
{: note}

## Before you begin
{: #automate-s4hana-ha-begin}

Before you deploy SAP S/4HANA High Availability on Single Zone or Multi Zone:

* The automation for this deployment requires {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} File Storage for VPC to complete successfully. {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} File Storage for VPC is available for customers with special approval to preview this service in the Frankfurt, London, Dallas, Toronto, Washington, Sao Paulo, Sydney, Osaka, and Tokyo regions. Contact your IBM Sales representative to get access. For more information, see [{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} File Storage for VPC](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-file-storage-vpc-about){: external}.
* Set up your account to access the VPC. Make sure that your account is [upgraded to a paid account](/docs/account?topic=account-accountfaqs#changeacct).
* If you have not already, create a bastion server to store the SAP kits. For more information, see [Automate SAP bastion server - SAP media storage repository](/docs/sap?topic=sap-sap-bastion-server).
* Download the SAP kits from the SAP Portal to your Deployment Server. Make note of the downloaded locations. Ansible decompresses the files. For more information, see the Readme file in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/IBM-Cloud/sap-s4hana-ha){: external} and on the About page for the catalog tile.

* [Create or retrieve your SSH key ID](/docs/ssh-keys?topic=ssh-keys-getting-started-tutorial). You need the 40-digit UUID for the SSH key, not the SSH key name.
* (Optional - catalog tile) create secrets for your credentials and passwords by using the [Secrets Manager](/docs/secrets-manager?topic=secrets-manager-arbitrary-secrets&interface=ui). {: ui}

## Deploying SAP HA S/4HANA by using Terraform with the bastion server CLI
{: #automate-s4hana-ha-deploy-terraform}
{: terraform}

Use these steps to configure the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Provider plug-in and use Terraform to install **SAP HA SZ or MZ S/4HANA** on your existing VPC. The scripts can take upto 4 hours to complete.
The supported versions available for S/4HANA are 2020, 2021, 2022, and 2023. For more information, see the [readme](https://github.com/IBM-Cloud/sap-s4hana-ha){: external} for recommended kits versions.

1. Access the bastion server CLI.
2. Clone the solution repository from `https://github.com/IBM-Cloud/sap-s4hana-ha` and `cd` to the `sap-s4hana-ha` folder.

    ```terraform
    git clone https://github.com/IBM-Cloud/sap-s4hana-ha.git

    cd sap-s4hana-ha

    ```

3. Specify your VPC. Modify the `input.auto.tfvars` file to specify the information for the existing VPC, your zone, VPC and component names, profile, and image. You need your 40-digit SSH key ID for this file. The second SSH key is optional. For more options for profile, see [Instance Profiles](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-profiles). For more options on images, see [Images](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-about-images).

5. Initialize the Terraform CLI.

    ```terraform
    terraform init
    ```

6. Create a Terraform execution plan. The Terraform execution plan summarizes all the actions that are done to create the virtual private cloud instance in your account.

    ```terraform
    terraform plan --out plan1
    ```

    You will be asked for the following sensitive variables:
    `'IBMCLOUD_API_KEY', 'SAP_MAIN_PASSWORD' HANA_MAIN_PASSWORD, and 'HA_PASSWORD'`.


    The SAP main password must be 10 - 14 characters long and contain at least one digit (0-9). It can contain only the following characters: a-z, A-Z, 0-9, @, #, $, _. This password cannot contain `!`. It must not start with a digit or an underscore ( _ ).

7. Verify that the plan shows all of the resources that you want to create and that the names and values are correct. If the plan needs to be adjusted, edit the `input.auto.tfvars` file to correct resources and run `terraform plan` again.
8. Create the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} resources for S/4HANA HA system and install the SAP system.

    ```terraform
    terraform apply "plan1"
    ```

    The virtual private cloud and components are created and you see output similar to the `terraform plan` output.

    ```terraform
    terraform destroy
    ```
    You will be asked for the following sensitive variables as a destroy confirmation phase:
    `'IBMCLOUD_API_KEY', 'SAP_MAIN_PASSWORD' HANA_MAIN_PASSWORD, and 'HA_PASSWORD'`.

## Next steps
{: #automate-s4hana-ha-next-steps}
{: terraform}

If you need to remove the SAP HA S/4HANA installation, go to your project folder and run `terraform destroy`. The `terraform destroy` command does not remove the VPC in this scenario because the VPC was not created with the same Terraform script.

# Configuring high availability for SAP S/4HANA (ASCS and ERS) on Red Hat Enterprise Linux HA Add-On clusters in a multizone region with simple mount
{: #ha-rhel-ensa-sm-mz}

The following information describes how to configure *ABAP SAP Central Services (ASCS)* and *Enqueue Replication Server (ERS)* in a Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) High Availability Add-On cluster.
The setup uses the *Simple Mount Structure*, a streamlined approach for mounting SAP application server directories.
The cluster runs on virtual server instances in [{{site.data.keyword.powerSysFull}}](https://www.ibm.com/products/power-virtual-server){: external}.
{: shortdesc}

This configuration example applies to the second generation of the [Standalone Enqueue Server](https://help.sap.com/docs/ABAP_PLATFORM/cff8531bc1d9416d91bb6781e628d4e0/902412f09e134f5bb875adb6db585c92.html){: external}, also known as *ENSA2*.

Since SAP S/4HANA 1809, ENSA2 is installed by default and supports both two-node and multi-node cluster configurations.
This example demonstrates a two-node RHEL HA Add-On cluster setup with ENSA2.
If the *ASCS* service fails, it automatically restarts on the node that hosts the *ERS* instance.
The lock entries are restored from the *ERS* instanceâ€™s copy of the lock table.
When the failed node is reactivated, the *ERS* instance relocates to the other node (anti-colocation) to maintain redundancy and protect the lock table copy.


Install the SAP database and other SAP application server instances on virtual servers outside the two-node cluster that is used for *ASCS* and *ERS*.

## Before you begin
{: #ha-rhel-ensa-sm-mz-begin}

Review the general requirements, product documentation, support articles, and SAP notes listed in [Implementing high availability for SAP applications on IBM {{site.data.keyword.powerSys_notm}} References](/docs/sap?topic=sap-ha-rhel-refs).

## Prerequisites
{: #ha-rhel-ensa-sm-mz-prerequisites}

The following NFS file systems must be mounted by the operating system on both cluster nodes.
These file systems are not managed by the HA cluster.
   - `/usr/sap/<SID>` contains directories for both the *ASCS* and *ERS* instances.
   - `/sapmnt/<SID>` hosts the *sapmnt* share.
   - `usr/sap/trans` might be required for shared transport directories (*saptrans*).

Ensure that a highly available NFS server is configured to provide these shared file systems.
Do not install the NFS server on any virtual server that is part of the *ENSA2* cluster.
This document does not cover the setup of file storage or the creation of cluster file system resources.
{: important}


Ensure that the virtual hostnames for the *ASCS* and *ERS* instances comply with the requirements that are outlined in [Hostnames of SAP ABAP Platform servers](https://me.sap.com/notes/611361){: external}.

The subnets and the virtual IP addresses for the *ASCS* and *ERS* instances must not exist in the {{site.data.keyword.powerSys_notm}} workspaces, as they are managed as cluster resources.
However, you must register the virtual IP addresses and hostnames for the *ASCS* and *ERS* instances in the Domain Name Service (DNS) and add them to the `etc/hosts` file on all cluster nodes.

## Preparing nodes to install ASCS and ERS instances
{: #ha-rhel-ensa-sm-mz-prepare-nodes}

The following information describes how to prepare the nodes for installing the SAP *ASCS* and *ERS* instances.

### Preparing environment variables
{: #ha-rhel-ensa-sm-mz-prepare-environment-variables}

{{../../_include-segments/powervs-ha-rhel-ensa-mz-prepare-env-vars.md}}

### Creating mount points for the instance file systems
{: #ha-rhel-ensa-sm-mz-create-mountpoints}

On both cluster nodes, run the following command to create the required mount points for the SAP instance file systems.

```sh
mkdir -p /usr/sap/${SID} /sapmnt/${SID}
```
{: pre}

## Installing and setting up the RHEL HA Add-On cluster
{: #ha-rhel-ensa-sm-mz-set-up}

Follow the instructions in [Implementing a Red Hat Enterprise Linux High Availability Add-On cluster in a multizone region environment](/docs/sap?topic=sap-ha-rhel-mz) to install and configure the RHEL HA Add-On cluster.
After installation, configure and test cluster fencing as described in [Creating the fencing device](/docs/sap?topic=sap-ha-rhel-mz#ha-rhel-mz-create-fencing-device).

## Preparing cluster resources before the SAP installation
{: #ha-rhel-ensa-sm-mz-clres-ascs-ers}

Ensure that the RHEL HA Add-On cluster is active on both virtual server instances, and verify that node fencing functions as expected.

### Configuring general cluster properties
{: #ha-rhel-ensa-sm-mz-configure-cluster-properties}

To prevent the cluster from relocating healthy resources, for example when previously failed node restarts, set the following default meta attributes.

- `resource-stickiness=1`: Ensures that resources remain on their current node.
- `migration-threshold=3`: Limits the number of failures before a resource is moved.

On NODE1, run the following command.

```sh
pcs resource defaults update resource-stickiness=1
```
{: pre}

```sh
pcs resource defaults update migration-threshold=3
```
{: pre}

### Configuring the NFS mounts
{: #ha-rhel-ensa-sm-mz-nfs-mounts}

The operating system mounts the NFS file systems on all cluster nodes.
These mounts are not managed by the HA cluster and must be configured manually in the `/etc/fstab` file system table.

In this example, the NFS server exports the subdirectories `SAP_${SID}/sapmnt` and `SAP_${SID}/usrsap${sid}`.
Adjust the paths as needed to match your NFS server configuration.

Run the following commands on both cluster nodes.

1. Check whether `/etc/fstab` already contains entries for the *sapmnt* and *saptrans* file systems.
   If not, add the required mount entries.

   Make sure to adjust the export paths to match your NFS server layout.

   ```sh
   cat >> /etc/fstab << EOT
   ${NFS_SERVER}:${NFS_SHARE}/SAP_${SID}/sapmnt /sapmnt/${SID} nfs4 ${NFS_OPTIONS} 0 0
   EOT
   ```
   {: pre}

   ```sh
   cat >> /etc/fstab << EOT
   ${NFS_SERVER}:${NFS_SHARE}/SAP_${SID}/usrsap${sid} /usr/sap/${SID} nfs4 ${NFS_OPTIONS} 0 0
   EOT
   ```
   {: pre}

   Ensure that duplicate entries are not added to `/etc/fstab`.
   Use `cat >>` only if the entries do not exist.
   {: important}

1. Mount the NFS file systems on both cluster nodes.

   ```sh
   mount /usr/sap/${SID}
   ```
   {: pre}

   ```sh
   mount /sapmnt/${SID}
   ```
   {: pre}

### Preparing to install the ASCS instance on NODE1
{: #ha-rhel-ensa-sm-mz-cfg-ascs-rg-prp}

{{../../_include-segments/powervs-ha-rhel-ensa-mz-create-ascs-vip.md}}

### Preparing to install the ERS instance on NODE2
{: #ha-rhel-ensa-sm-mz-cfg-ers-rg-prp}

{{../../_include-segments/powervs-ha-rhel-ensa-mz-create-ers-vip.md}}

### Verifying the cluster configuration
{: #ha-rhel-ensa-sm-mz-verify-cluster-config-before-sap-install}

On NODE1, run the following command to verify the current cluster configuration and ensure that all resources are correctly defined and active.

```sh
pcs status --full
```
{: pre}

Sample output:

```sh
# pcs status --full
Cluster name: SAP_S01

{: screen}

Ensure that the `${sid}_ascs${ASCS_INSTNO}_group` cluster resource group is running on NODE1, and that the `${sid}_ers${ERS_INSTNO}_group` cluster resource group is running on NODE2.
If needed, use the `pcs resource move <resource_group_name>` command to relocate the resource group to the appropriate node.


### Changing the ownership of the ASCS and ERS mount points
{: #ha-rhel-ensa-sm-mz-verify-change-mountpoint-owner}

The *ASCS* and *ERS* mount points must be owned by the *sidadm* user.
Before you start the instance installation, ensure that the required users and groups are defined and that the mount point ownership is correctly set.

Follow these steps on both nodes to configure the correct ownership.

1. Start the *SAP Software Provisioning Manager (SWPM)* to create the operating system users and groups.

   ```sh
   <swpm>/sapinst
   ```
   {: screen}

   In the SWPM web interface, go to *System Rename > Preparations > Operating System Users and Group*.
   Record the user and group IDss, and verify that they are identical on both nodes.

1. Change the ownership of the mount points.

   ```sh
   chown -R ${sid}adm:sapsys /sapmnt/${SID} /usr/sap/${SID}
   ```
   {: pre}

## Installing the ASCS and ERS instances
{: #ha-rhel-ensa-sm-mz-install-sap-instances}

Use SWPM to install both instances.

- Install *ASCS* and *ERS* instances on the cluster nodes.
   - On NODE1, use the virtual hostname `${ASCS_VH}`, which is associated with the *ASCS* virtual IP address, to install the *ASCS* instance.

   ```sh
   <swpm>/sapinst SAPINST_USE_HOSTNAME=${ASCS_VH}
   ```
   {: screen}

   - On NODE2, use the virtual hostname `${ERS_VH}`, which is associated with the *ERS* virtual IP address, to install the *ERS* instance.

   ```sh
   <swpm>/sapinst SAPINST_USE_HOSTNAME=${ERS_VH}
   ```
   {: screen}

- Install all other SAP application instances outside the cluster environment.

## Preparing the ASCS and ERS instances for cluster integration
{: #ha-rhel-ensa-sm-mz-prepare-ascs-ers}

{{../../_include-segments/powervs-ha-rhel-ensa-prepare-for-cluster.md}}

## Verifying the `resource-agents-sap` package version
{: #ha-rhel-ensa-sm-mz-verify-resource-agents-version}

The *Simple Mount* configuration for SAP application servers requires version **4.15.1 or later** of the `resource-agents-sap` package.
{: important}

To check the installed version, run the following command.
The output follows the format: `resource-agents-sap-<version>.<release>.noarch`

```sh
rpm -q resource-agents-sap
```
{: pre}

Sample output:

```sh
# rpm -q resource-agents-sap
resource-agents-sap-4.15.1-1.el9_4.1.noarch
```
{: screen}

## Configuring the ASCS and ERS cluster resources
{: #ha-rhel-ensa-sm-mz-cfg-ascs-ers}

At this stage, the following prerequisites are assumed to be complete:

- A RHEL HA Add-On cluster is running on both virtual server instances and node fencing is tested.
- The *sapmnt* share and the *usrsap* share are mounted on both cluster nodes.
- Two *powervs-subnet* cluster resources are configured for the virtual IP addresses of the *ASCS* and *ERS* instances.
- The *ASCS* instance is installed and active on NODE1.
- THE *ERS* instance is installed and active on NODE2.
- All steps that are described in [Prepare ASCS and ERS instances for the cluster integration](/docs/sap?topic=sap-ha-rhel-ensa#ha-rhel-ensa-prepare-ascs-ers) are complete.

### Configuring the ASCS cluster resource group
{: #ha-rhel-ensa-sm-mz-cfg-ascs-rg}

On NODE1, run the following command to create a cluster resource that manages the SAP instance agent for the *ASCS* instance.

```sh
pcs resource create ${sid}_srv_ascs${ASCS_INSTNO} SAPStartSrv \
    InstanceName="${SID}_ASCS${ASCS_INSTNO}_${ASCS_VH}" \
    group ${sid}_ascs${ASCS_INSTNO}_group \
    --future
```
{: pre}

Next, on NODE1, create a cluster resource to manage the *ASCS* instance.

```sh
pcs resource create ${sid}_ascs${ASCS_INSTNO} SAPInstance \
    InstanceName="${SID}_ASCS${ASCS_INSTNO}_${ASCS_VH}" \
    START_PROFILE=/sapmnt/${SID}/profile/${SID}_ASCS${ASCS_INSTNO}_${ASCS_VH} \
    AUTOMATIC_RECOVER=false \
    meta resource-stickiness=5000 \
    migration-threshold=1 failure-timeout=60 \
    op monitor interval=20 on-fail=restart timeout=60 \
    op start interval=0 timeout=600 \
    op stop interval=0 timeout=600 \
    group ${sid}_ascs${ASCS_INSTNO}_group \
    --future
```
{: pre}

The `meta resource-stickiness=5000` option balances the failover behavior for the ERS instance.
This option ensures that the resource remains on its original node and does not migrate unexpectedly within the cluster.
{: note}

To ensure that the *ASCS* instance remains on its designated node, add resource stickiness to the group.

```sh
pcs resource meta ${sid}_ascs${ASCS_INSTNO}_group \
    resource-stickiness=3000
```
{: pre}

### Configuring the ERS cluster resource group
{: #ha-rhel-ensa-sm-mz-cfg-ers-rg}

On NODE2, run the following command to create a cluster resource that manages the SAP instance agent for the *ERS* instance.

```sh
pcs resource create ${sid}_srv_ers${ERS_INSTNO} SAPStartSrv \
    InstanceName="${SID}_ERS${ERS_INSTNO}_${ERS_VH}" \
    group ${sid}_ers${ERS_INSTNO}_group \
    --future
```
{: pre}


Next, on NODE2, create a cluster resource to manage the *ERS* instance.

```sh
pcs resource create ${sid}_ers${ERS_INSTNO} SAPInstance \
    InstanceName="${SID}_ERS${ERS_INSTNO}_${ERS_VH}" \
    START_PROFILE=/sapmnt/${SID}/profile/${SID}_ERS${ERS_INSTNO}_${ERS_VH} \
    AUTOMATIC_RECOVER=false \
    IS_ERS=true \
    op monitor interval=20 on-fail=restart timeout=60 \
    op start interval=0 timeout=600 \
    op stop interval=0 timeout=600 \
    group ${sid}_ers${ERS_INSTNO}_group \
    --future
```
{: pre}

### Configuring the cluster constraints
{: #ha-rhel-ensa-sm-mz-cfg-constraints}

On NODE1, run the following commands to configure cluster constraints.

A colocation constraint ensures that the resource groups `${sid}_ascs${ASCS_INSTNO}_group` and `${sid}_ers${ERS_INSTNO}_group` do not run on the same node, if at least two nodes are available.
If only one node is available, the stickiness value of `-5000` allows both groups to run on the same node.

```sh
pcs constraint colocation add \
    ${sid}_ers${ERS_INSTNO}_group with ${sid}_ascs${ASCS_INSTNO}_group -- -5000
```
{: pre}

An order constraint ensures that `${sid}_ascs${ASCS_INSTNO}_group` starts before `${sid}_ers${ERS_INSTNO}_group`.

```sh
pcs constraint order start \
    ${sid}_ascs${ASCS_INSTNO}_group then stop ${sid}_ers${ERS_INSTNO}_group \
    symmetrical=false \
    kind=Optional
```
{: pre}

## Conclusion
{: #ha-rhel-ensa-sm-mz-conclusion}

The *ENSA2* cluster implementation in a multizone region environment is now complete.

# Deploying SAP HANA db backup to Cloud Object Storage on existing {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} VPC with automation
{: #sap-automate-hana-db-backup-cos-deploy}

You can use Terraform scripts to create the required setup for storing HANA db backup in IBM Cloud Object Storage (COS), in case of a HANA database instance that is already deployed in the VPC. The Terraform scripts use the VPC information that you provide and then call the Ansible playbooks to create the SAP architecture on the specified VPC. Terraform on {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} enables predictable and consistent provisioning of {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) infrastructure resources so that you can rapidly build complex cloud environments. {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} VPC infrastructure consists of SAP certified hardware that uses Intel&reg; Xeon CPUs and additional Intel&reg; technologies.
{: shortdesc}

You have two deployment methods to choose from:

* Terraform scripts run from the CLI on your deployment server (bastion server).
* {{site.data.keyword.bpshort}} user interface accessed from your cloud dashboard menu.

You can store the SAP HANA db backup into the Cloud Object Storage.

## SAP solution implemented
{: #sap-hana-db-backup-cos-proc}

![Figure 1. Backup SAP HANA db into Cloud Object Storage from a standard SAP NW on HANA db architecture](images/sap-hana-backup-on-vpc.svg "Backup SAP HANA db into Cloud Object Storage from a standard SAP NW on HANA db architecture"){: caption="Backup SAP HANA db into Cloud Object Storage from a standard SAP NW on HANA db architecture" caption-side="bottom"}

## What is created
{: #sap-hana-db-backup-cos-created}

This automation solution is designed for the implementation of SAP HANA Backup solution that uses Backint and [{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Object Storage](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cloud-object-storage?topic=cloud-object-storage-getting-started-cloud-object-storage){: external}. It is based on SAP note "2935898 - Install and Configure SAP HANA Backint Agent for Amazon S3".

The minimum version of SAP HANA Backint Agent for Amazon S3 to be used for {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Object Storage is 1.2.17. SAP HANA Backint Agent for Amazon S3 requires Python 3.7 including SSL support. The Python package delivered as part of the SAP HANA 2 installation does not include SSL support. Python 3.7 with SSL support is installed in /usr/local/bin directory, if it is not previously installed. SAP HANA Backint Agent for Amazon S3 is installed in the `/hana/shared/< SID >/backint_agent` directory.

The setup runs initial full data backup to Cloud Object Storage for system and tenant databases. The regular backup policy for the databases must be configured by the customer.

All data backup, log backup, and catalog backup files are saved in the same dedicated bucket (with no enforced storage quota) created in a Cloud Object Storage instance by using an existing bastion host with secure remote SSH access in the same {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Gen2 VPC as the SAP HANA system. The setup uses the Regional Storage Class with the Smart Tier pricing option and the standard pricing plan. The SAP HANA system is deployed on one of the following operating systems:

* SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15 SP 4 for SAP
* SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15 SP 3 for SAP
* Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.6 for SAP
* Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.4 for SAP

## Script files
{: #sap-hana-db-backup-cos-script-files}
{: terraform}

The configuration and script files are available in GitHub.
[GitHub repository for Terraform - HANA backup Cloud Object Storage](https://github.com/IBM-Cloud/sap-hana-backup-cos){: external}

## Schematics deployment
{: #sap-hana-db-backup-cos-schematics}
{: ui}

The configuration and script files are provided in [GitHub](https://github.com/IBM-Cloud/sap-hana-backup-cos){: external}.
When the {{site.data.keyword.bpshort}} interface is used, the following information should be provided:

* the workspace information.
* the GitHub path for the solution.
* the values for the parameters in the {{site.data.keyword.bpshort}} interface; they are the same as the parameters from `input.auto.tfvars` file, which are used in CLI.

## Terraform interface
{: #sap-hana-db-backup-terraform-interface}
{: terraform}

To run the Terraform script, you should modify:

* The `input.auto.tfvars` file, to specify the existing VPC resources for your solution. You should provide the values for the following variables:
    * VPC name
    * Region
    * Security group
    * Subnet
    * Resource Group
    * HostName(s)
    * Setup for HA
    * Number of backup retention days

You can change the default SAP system configuration settings to match your solution. You also specify the location where you downloaded the SAP kits.

The {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Provider plug-in for Terraform on {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} uses these configuration files and the Ansible playbooks to store the HANA db backup into Cloud Object Storage for an already installed HANA database instance, in the specified VPC, in your {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} account.

## Virtual server instance configuration
{: #sap-hana-db-backup-cos-vsi-config}
{: ui}

This solution is applied on existing VSIs with SAP HANA deployed in an existing VPC. See below for more information:

* https://github.com/IBM-Cloud/sap-netweaver-abap-hana
* https://github.com/IBM-Cloud/sap-netweaver-java-hana
* https://github.com/IBM-Cloud/sap-s4hana
* https://github.com/IBM-Cloud/sap-bw4hana
* https://github.com/IBM-Cloud/sap-netweaver-abap-hana
* https://github.com/IBM-Cloud/sap-s4hana-ha

## Before you begin
{: #sap-hana-db-backup-cos-before}
{: ui}

Before you use the scripts:

* An SAP HANA system that is built on one of the above OS should be deployed in an IBM Cloud Gen2 VPC, on a single host with or without HA.

* A bastion server with secure remote SSH access must be deployed in the same region and zone of {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Gen2 VPC as the SAP HANA system.

* A pair of SSH keys used to run the automation for the backup configuration should be available. The public SSH key should be manually added on SAP HANA VSI in `/root/.ssh/authorized_keys` and uploaded in {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}.

* The {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} user running the automation for SAP HANA backup should have the role of Manager on {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Object Storage. To view or use the credentials, the user should have the IAM level access action "resource-controller.credential.retrieve_all". This permission is given to the administrator role and overrides any credential level access enabling the user to view the credentials.

To provide the access for the required roles to run the "SAP HANA db backup to Cloud Object Storage", go to https://cloud.ibm.com/iam/users and select the USER_ID to run the automation.

   ![Figure 1. SAP HANA db backup to Cloud Object Storage](images/grant_permissions_cos.png "SAP HANA db backup to Cloud Object Storage"){: caption="SAP HANA db backup to Cloud Object Storage" caption-center="bottom"}

* The kit of the backup agent for the IBM COS `aws-s3-backint-.*-linuxx86_64.tar.gz` should be manually uploaded on the deployment server (bastion server). This kit is part of the SAP HANA kit file and can be found in `*/DATA_UNITS/HDB_SERVER_LINUX_X86_64/server` path. Either the entire SAP HANA kit or only the kit of the backup agent for IBM COS can be provided, but the minimum backint agent kit version to be used is `aws-s3-backint-1.2.17-linuxx86_64`

* The Python script `create_hdbbackint.py` provided by SAP (SAP note 2935898 - Install and Configure SAP HANA Backint Agent for Amazon S3) to modify the `hdbbackint` script so that it points to the Python 3 libraries must be manually uploaded on the bastion server.

* The HANA DB system user should have the same password for SYSTEMDB and all tenant databases.

## Before you begin
{: #sap-hana-db-backup-before}
{: terraform}

You need the following to get started with {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Object Storage:

*	Go to [{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Platform account](https://cloud.ibm.com/){: external}.
*	Set up your account to access the VPC. Make sure that your account is [upgraded to a paid account](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/account?topic=account-accountfaqs#changeacct){: external}.
*	Create a deployment server (bastion server) to store the SAP kits. For more information, see the [Automate SAP bastion server - SAP media storage repository](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/sap?topic=sap-sap-bastion-server){: external}
*	Download the SAP kits from the SAP Portal to your Deployment Server. Make note of the downloaded locations. Ansible decompresses the files. For more information, see the [Readme](https://github.com/IBM-Cloud/sap-hana-backup-cos/blob/main/README.md){: external} file.
*	[Create or retrieve an {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} API key](/docs/account?topic=account-userapikey&interface=ui#create_user_key){: external}. The API key is used to authenticate with the create or retrieve your SSH key ID.
*	Log in to the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} platform and to determine your permissions for {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} services.
*	Terraform should be already installed on the deployment server (bastion server) that you deployed. For more information, see the [Bastion server for SAP deployment](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/sap?topic=sap-sap-bastion-server){: external}.
*	Before using "HANA db backup to Cloud Object Storage" automation module the HANA database instance(s) should be installed on the specified VPC in your {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} account.
*	Ensure you have the same password for all your HANA db system users before you run this automation module for HANA backup in Cloud Object Storage.

## Creating the infrastructure by using the Terraform CLI and the deployment server (bastion server)
{: #create-hana-db-backup-cli}
{: terraform}

Use these steps and "HANA db backup to Cloud Object Storage" automation module to configure the backup of SAP HANA db into Cloud Object Storage for an already deployed SAP HANA db 2.0, in your existing VPC.

The scripts take 1-2 hours to complete. A full backup of System DB and Tenant DB is executed at the end.

1.	Access the deployment server (bastion server) CLI.
2.	Clone the solution repository from https://github.com/IBM-Cloud/sap-hana-backup-cos

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/IBM-Cloud/sap-hana-backup-cos.git

    cd sap-hana-backup-cos
    ```

3.	Specify your VPC. Modify the `input.auto.tfvars` file to specify the information for the existing VPC and component names. For descriptions of the variables, see the [Readme](https://github.com/IBM-Cloud/sap-hana-backup-cos/blob/main/README.md){: external} file.
    The VSI OS images that are validated for the automation solution "HANA db backup to Cloud Object Storage" are:
    *	SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15 SP 4 for SAP
    *	SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15 SP 3 for SAP,
    *	Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.6 for SAP or
    *	Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.4 for SAP

    Note: Any of the above OS distributions and versions can be used for the prior deployment of the host(s) for the HANA db (with or without HA) in an IBM Cloud Gen2 VPC. This HANA backup solution was implemented and tested on the following OS images available in {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}: ibm-sles-15-4-amd64-sap-hana-3, ibm-sles-15-3-amd64-sap-hana-3, ibm-redhat-8-6-amd64-sap-hana-2, ibm-redhat-8-4-amd64-sap-hana-2.

    ```terraform
    # Infra VPC variables
    REGION           = "eu-de"
    VPC              = "ic4sap"
    SECURITY_GROUP   = "ic4sap-securitygroup"
    RESOURCE_GROUP   = "wes-automation"
    SUBNET           = "ic4sap-subnet"
    ID_RSA_FILE_PATH = "/root/.ssh/id_rsa_backup"

    # Cloud Object Storage variables:

    LIFECYCLE_POLICY = "60"

    # HANA VSI variables:

    HA_CLUSTER       = "yes/no"
    DB_HOSTNAME_1    = "hanadb-vsi1"
    DB_HOSTNAME_2    = ""
    ```

4.	Customize your SAP system configuration. In the same `input.auto.tfvars` file, edit the SAP system configuration variables that are passed to the Ansible automated deployment. For descriptions of the variables, see the [Readme](https://github.com/IBM-Cloud/sap-hana-backup-cos/blob/main/README.md){: external} file.

    ```terraform
    # SAP HANA backup configuration

    HANA_SID                 = "HDB"
    HANA_SYSNO               = "00"
    HANA_TENANTS             = ["Ten_HDB1", "Ten_HDB2"]

    # Kits paths - for HANA db backup to Cloud Object Storage

    BACKINT_COS_KIT          = "/storage/hdb_backup_kit_files/aws-s3-backint/aws-s3-backint-1.2.18-linuxx86_64.tar.gz"
    HANA_KIT_FOR_BACKINT_COS = ""
    CREATE_HDBBACKINT_SCRIPT ="/storage/hana_backup_kit_files/create_hdbbackint.py"
    ```

5.	Initialize the Terraform CLI.

    ```sh
    terraform init
    ```

6.	Create a Terraform execution plan. The Terraform execution plan summarizes all the actions that are performed by the automation scripts based on the input variables.

    ```sh
    terraform plan --out plan1
    ```

    You should enter an SAP HANA main password (which should be the same for all your HANA SYSTEM db users) and your API key. The SAP main password should be 10 - 14 characters long and contain at least one digit (0-9). It can contain only the following characters: a-z, A-Z, 0-9, @, #, $, . This password cannot contain exclamation points '!'. The password should not start with a digit or an underscore ().
7.	Verify that the plan shows all of the resources that you want to create and that the names and values are correct. If the plan needs to be adjusted, edit the input.auto.tfvars file to correct resources and run terraform plan again.

8.	Apply the saved terraform plan.

    ```sh
    terraform apply "plan1"
    ```

    Resources are created and you see output similar to the terraform plan output.

10.	 {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Object Storage instance and bucket are created and the Hana DB system is configured to use backint backup.

11.	Add the SAP credentials and the virtual server instance IP to the SAP GUI or HANA STUDIO. For more information about the SAP GUI, see SAP GUI.

## Next steps
{: #sap-hana-db-backup-next}
{: terraform}

Do not use the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Dashboard and user interface to modify your VPC after it is created. The Terraform scripts create a complete solution and selectively modifying resources with the user interface might cause unexpected results.

If you need to remove the backup service:

Remove the "Hana backup to Cloud Object Storage" configuration and delete the Cloud Object Storage.

First change/adapt Hana backup configuration to not use backint/backup to {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Object Storage:
1. Check and change/delete any Hana database backup job (for SYSTEM and tenant DBs) already scheduled, by using the same tool that you used to schedule the job (OS crontab, SAP DB13, SAP HANA Cockpit, Hana Studio) to not use the backint/backup to {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Object Storage.
2. Make sure that the Hana "LOG Backup Settings" is changed from backint/backup to Cloud Object Storage to any other "Destination type" (file/disk, other backup tool). You can use SAP HANA Cockpit, Hana Studio, or other tool.
    Double check in the "Hana backup log" file and the new backup location to see whether Hana logs are automatically backed up as needed.
3. Make sure that Hana "Backup Catalog" destination is changed from backint/backup to Cloud Object Storage to any other "Destination type" (file/disk, other backup tool). You might use SAP Hana Cockpit, Hana Studio.
4. Make sure that you don't need the previous backups of Hana data and logs saved to Cloud Object Storage. Cloud Object Storage and all Hana data backups and logs backups are deleted. Make sure you saved them before in another location if you still need them.
5. Run a full DATA backup test for SYSTEM and Tenant DBs using the new backup location (file/disk, other backup tool), different from {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Object Storage. Make sure that all backups complete succesfuly in the new location.
6. Check and reschedule full data backups for SYSTEM and tenant DBs using the new "Destination type" (file/disk, other backup tool).

Second, release the IBM Bucket and delete all the backups:
1. Run `terraform destroy` to delete the used IBM bucket (the Cloud Object Storage instance, as well) and all its contents/backups.
- The used files/directories for "Python 3.7 with ssl support" and "S3 backint" are still present at the OS level on Hana VSI but Hana will no longer use them.

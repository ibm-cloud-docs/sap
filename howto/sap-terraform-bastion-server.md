# Deploying the SAP bastion server â€“ SAP media storage repository
{: #sap-bastion-server}

This topic describes how to do an automated deployment of SAP bastion and storage setup on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.4. It shows how to deploy an {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) with a bastion host with secure remote SSH access. In SAP Terraform and Ansible deployments, the bastion host is used to give external administrative access to the other servers and applications. The bastion server is accessed through the Floating IP. The bastion server includes a customizable security group and subnet to enable access to the same region zones on its dedicated SAP/DBs and the VSI's IPs and ports. The floating IP also allows the bastion host access to the internet so the sap and DB kits can be downloaded. Also, a dedicated client-to-site VPN solution will be created automatically to provides direct access to the private IP address for future SAP servers, using an OpenVPN software client.

Before you decide which SAP automated solution you want to deploy in {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} VPC, run the bastion server automated deployment. You need to specify the amount of dedicated storage that is needed to download and store the SAP kits. The SAP kits are used to deploy wanted SAP solution from the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} VPC automated SAP solutions pool. The bastion server in {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} is primarily used for SAP solution deployment. It can be used as a Jump Host, for example, to maintain and administer all SAP solutions within its respective {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} VPC region.

Each customer is given an SAP S-user that reflects their contractual details with SAP, including:
* SAP support
* SAP Notes
* System maintenance
* Generate and maintain SAP and DB licenses
* Migrations keys

It is the customers responsibility to download and prepare the necessary SAP kits from [SAP launchpad support](https://launchpad.support.sap.com/){: external} and store them on the dedicated and customizable storage. The SAP kits are used during automated deployment when Ansible is called.

## Solution implemented
{: #bastion-solution-implemented}

The Bastion server is used for remote software installation by using Terraform remote-exec and Ansible playbooks run by Schematics.

![Figure 1. Standard Bastion within a VPC region with 3 zones](images/sap-terraform-bastion-server.svg "Standard Bastion within a VPC region with 3 zones"){: caption="Standard Bastion within a VPC region with 3 zones" caption-side="bottom"}

The Terraform modules implement a 'reasonable' set of best practices for bastion host configuration only. Your own Organization might have more requirements that you must apply before the deployment.

It contains:
*	Terraform scripts for deploying a VPC, Subnet, Security Group with default and custom rules, a VSI with a volume, a Secrets Manager service instance and a VPN client-to-site solution.
*	Bash scripts to install the prerequisites for SAP BASTION&STORAGE VSI and other SAP solutions.

### VPC Configuration
{: #sap-bastion-vpc-config}

The Security Rules are:
*	Allow all traffic in the Security group
*	Allow all outbound traffic
*	Allow inbound DNS traffic (UDP port 53)
*	Allow inbound SSH traffic (TCP port 22)
*	Option to Allow inbound TCP traffic with a custom port or a range of ports.

### VSI Configuration
{: #sap-bastion-vso-config}

The VSI is configured with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.4 (amd64), has a minimal of two SSH keys that are configured to be accessed by the root user and one storage volume.

### VPN Configuration
{: #sap-bastion-vpn-config}

For the VPN solution, a Secrets Manager instance will be provisioned. Two secrets are provisioned, the server certificate and the client certificate; both will be used during the VPN creation and also to generate the `ovpn` file for the connection. You can see these secrets under the Secrets Managers page > Secrets and select **View secret** option.

The VPN server will have a dedicated Security Group. The Security Group will open the UDP port 443 for all source IP addresses. This can be later customized according to the customers needs.

A rule is added for the bastion's Security Group to allow all the traffic from the VPN's Security Group.
Later, if other Security Groups are added to the VPC and you want to allow access to their attached resources through the VPN connection, then the same rule should be configured for those as well.

The automation script will generate on the bastion server an ovpn profile file for your OpenVPN client. You need to download from the bastion and import in your OpenVPN client.

### Software configuration
{: #sap-bastion-software-config}

*	Terraform - an open source infrastructure as code software tool created by HashiCorp.
*	Ansible - an open source software provisioning and configuration management tool.
*	The {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Command Line Interface provides commands for managing resources in {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}.

## Before you begin
{: #sap-bastion-before-begin}

1. To complete this procedure, you need a general understanding of {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} VPC and VSIs. To run the example in {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Schematics, you need an {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} account. The deployed resources are chargeable.

2. [Create or retrieve an {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} API key](/docs/account?topic=account-userapikey&interface=ui#create_user_key). The API key is used to authenticate with the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} platform and to determine your permissions for {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} services.

3. Be sure that you have the [required {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} IAM permissions](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-managing-user-permissions-for-vpc-resources) to create and work with VPC infrastructure and you are [assigned the correct permissions](/docs/schematics?topic=schematics-access) to create the workspace and deploy resources.

4. [Generate an SSH key](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-ssh-keys). The SSH key is required to access the provisioned VPC virtual server instances through the bastion host. After you create your SSH key, make sure to [upload this SSH key to your {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} account](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-ssh-keys&interface=ui#import-ssh-keys-ui) in the VPC region and resource group where you want to deploy the bastion server.

5. Verify that you can access the URL used for this solution [Automation script for SAP solutions using a BASTION & STORAGE setup deployment through Terraform and IBM Schematics](https://github.com/IBM-Cloud/sap-bastion-setup){: external}.

6. [Create an IAM service-to-service authorization for your VPN server and IBM Cloud Secrets Manager](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-client-to-site-authentication#creating-iam-service-to-service). This will allow the client-to-site VPN service to access and use the secrets created under the Secrets Manager instance.

## Procedure

1. From the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} menu, select [Schematics](https://cloud.ibm.com/schematics/overview){: external}.
2. Click Create workspace.
3. On the **Specify template** page:
    * Enter the URL of bastion setup folder.
    * Select the **Terraform version**.
    * Click Next.
4. On the Workspace details page:
    * Enter a name for the workspace.
    * Select a **Resource group**.

     * Security group name
     * Hostname
     * Profile
     * Image
     * Minimal recommended disk sizes.
     * Click Save changes.
7. On the workspace Settings page, click **Generate plan**. Wait for the plan to complete.
8. Click **View log** to review the log files of your Terraform execution plan.
9. Apply your Terraform template by clicking **Apply plan**.
10. Review the log file to make sure that no errors occurred during the provisioning, modification, or deletion process.
11. At the end of the log is information that you need to deploy different SAP products and databases. Copy and save this information for your deployments. For example:

    ```
    2024/09/16 12:01:08 Terraform refresh | FLOATING_IP = " xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx "
    2024/09/16 12:01:08 Terraform refresh | HOSTNAME = "myhost"
    2024/09/16 12:01:08 Terraform refresh | OVPN_FILE = "/root/OpenVPN.ovpn"
    2024/09/16 12:01:08 Terraform refresh | PRIVATE_IP = " xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx "
    2024/09/16 12:01:08 Terraform refresh | REGION = "eu-de"
    2024/09/16 12:01:08 Terraform refresh | SECURITY_GROUP = "secgrp-myhost "
    2024/09/16 12:01:08 Terraform refresh | SUBNET = [
    2024/09/16 12:01:08 Terraform refresh |   "myvpc-subnet-1",
    2024/09/16 12:01:08 Terraform refresh |   "myvpc-subnet-2",
    2024/09/16 12:01:08 Terraform refresh |   "myvpc-subnet-3",
    2024/09/16 12:01:08 Terraform refresh | VPC = "myvpc"
    2024/09/16 12:01:08 Terraform refresh | VPN_HOSTNAME = "xxxxxx.eu-der.vpn-server.appdomain.cloud"
    ```

12. Your OpenVPN client profile file is on the bastion server under `OVPN_FILE` path displayed in the output. Copy the file and share with the required users. Import this file in your OpenVPN client. Once the OpenVPN client connects, you are able to reach the private IP addressing space of the bastion server.

This automation is offered at no cost; however, the provisioned infrastructure comes at cost.

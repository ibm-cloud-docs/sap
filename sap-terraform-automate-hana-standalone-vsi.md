# Deploying SAP HANA stand-alone virtual server instance on {{site.data.keyword.cloud}} VPC
{: #automate-terraform-sap-hana-vsi}

As of 28 March 2024, the {{site.data.keyword.at_full_notm}} service is deprecated and will no longer be supported as of 30 March 2025. Customers will need to migrate to {{site.data.keyword.logs_full_notm}} before 30 March 2025. During the migration period, customers can use {{site.data.keyword.at_full_notm}} along with {{site.data.keyword.logs_full_notm}}. Activity tracking events are the same for both services. For information about migrating from {{site.data.keyword.at_full_notm}} to {{site.data.keyword.logs_full_notm}} and running the services in parallel, see [migration planning](/docs/cloud-logs?topic=cloud-logs-migration-intro).
{: important}

You can use Terraform scripts to create a single-tier SAP HANA DB on VSI or Bare Metal Server in a VPC. The Terraform scripts use the VPC information that you provide and then call the Ansible playbooks to create the SAP architecture on the specified VPC.

Terraform on {{site.data.keyword.cloud}} enables predictable and consistent provisioning of {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} VPC infrastructure resources so that you can rapidly build complex cloud environments. {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} VPC infrastructure consists of SAP certified hardware by using Intel&reg; Xeon CPUs and additional Intel&reg; technologies.
{: shortdesc}

For more information about Terraform on {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}, see [Getting started with Terraform on {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}](/docs/ibm-cloud-provider-for-terraform?topic=ibm-cloud-provider-for-terraform-getting-started).

To create resources with Terraform, you can use Terraform configuration files that describe the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} resources that you need and how you want to configure them. Based on your configuration, Terraform creates an execution plan and describes the actions that need to be run to create the resources. You can review the execution plan, change it, or run the plan.

You have two deployment methods to choose from:

* Terraform scripts run from the CLI on your bastion server.
* The schematic user interface is accessed from the menu on your cloud dashboard.

## Prerequisites
{: #terraform-sap-hana-vsi-prerequisites}
{: terraform}

A deployment server (bastion server) deployed by using the automation solution [Automate SAP bastion server – SAP media storage repository](https://test.cloud.ibm.com/docs/sap?topic=sap-sap-bastion-server){: external}, should exist in the same VPC, same region, and have the same subnet and security group that is configured for the SAP system VSIs.

Required IAM permissions for deploying SAP HANA on Bare Metal: Bare Metal Console Administrator role to access the ESXi Direct Console User Interface (DCUI) and Bare Metal Advanced Network Operator role to modify IP spoofing and infrastructure NAT configuration on network interfaces. For more information, see [Planning for Bare Metal Servers on VPC](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-planning-for-bare-metal-servers){: external}.

## What is created
{: #terraform-sap-hana-vsi-created}

The scripts automate the deployment of the virtual infrastructure resources and the provisioning processes for SAP architecture in an existing VPC. An SAP HANA DB on a virtual server instance or bare metal server is provisioned in VPC. The deployment happens in two phases in one run.

During the first phase, a virtual server instance or bare metal server with SAP HANA certified storage and network configuration is created. The security group and a subnet used for the deployment server (bastion server) are required.

During the second phase, the Ansible playbooks are run and the SAP HANA 2.0 architecture is installed on the SAP HANA VSI box or on the SAP HANA bare metal server.

There are two types of servers where this solution can be deployed on {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Virtual Private Cloud (VPC): Virtual Server Instances (VSIs) and Bare Metal servers. For each server type, there are specific profiles that are certified by SAP. A profile is a combination of instance attributes, such as the number of vCPUs, amount of RAM, network bandwidth, and default bandwidth allocation. The attributes define the size and capabilities of the virtual server instance that is provisioned.

### x86-64 virtual server instance profiles
{: #x86-64-instance-profiles}

For {{site.data.keyword.cloud}} virtual servers for VPC, there are eight profile families:

* Balanced
* Compute
* Memory
* Very High Memory
* Ultra High Memory
* GPU
* Storage Optimized
* Confidential Compute

For more information, see [x86-64 instance profiles](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-profiles&interface=ui).

When you provision {{site.data.keyword.cloud}} virtual server instances for SAP HANA on VPC, you can select from three families of certified profiles: Memory Optimized, Very High Memory Optimized and Ultra High Memory Optimized. For more information about virtual server instances certified profiles for SAP HANA, see [Intel Virtual Server certified profiles on VPC infrastructure for SAP HANA](/docs/sap?topic=sap-hana-iaas-offerings-profiles-intel-vs-vpc).

### x86-64 bare metal server profiles
{: x86-64-bare-metal-server-profiles}

{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Bare Metal Servers on VPC Infrastructure are dedicated bare metal servers that provide enhanced networking and connectivity through [Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/vpc) capabilities. For more information on bare metal servers, see [IBM Cloud Bare Metal Servers](https://www.ibm.com/products/bare-metal-servers?_gl=1*164pqfh*_ga*MTU0MzcxNzExMS4xNjcxNzI2MjI4*_ga_FYECCCS21D*MTY4NjY3MDgzOC43NC4xLjE2ODY2NzE2OTEuMC4wLjA.&_ga=2.80093343.964139216.1686574517-1543717111.1671726228){: external}.

The bare metal servers on VPC are available as an integrated part of [{{site.data.keyword.cloud}}](https://www.ibm.com/cloud?_gl=1*opgtue*_ga*MTU0MzcxNzExMS4xNjcxNzI2MjI4*_ga_FYECCCS21D*MTY4NjY3MDgzOC43NC4xLjE2ODY2NzE2OTEuMC4wLjA.&_ga=2.55889827.964139216.1686574517-1543717111.1671726228). For more information, see [x86-64 bare metal server profiles](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-bare-metal-servers-profile&interface=ui){: external} on {{site.data.keyword.cloud}}.

When you provision an {{site.data.keyword.cloud}} bare metal server for SAP HANA on VPC, you can select from four families of certified profiles:
* Balanced
* Compute Optimized
* Memory Optimized
* Ultra High Memory Optimized

For more information about the bare metal server certified profiles for SAP HANA, see [Bare metal server certified profiles on VPC infrastructure for SAP HANA](/docs/sap?topic=sap-hana-iaas-offerings-profiles-intel-bm-vpc).

## SAP HANA server configuration
{: #terraform-sap-hana-vsi-config}
{: terraform}

The following operating systems and OS images are supported:

* Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.6 for SAP HANA (amd64) - images: `ibm-redhat-8-6-amd64-sap-hana-<x>`
* Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.4 for SAP HANA (amd64) - images: `ibm-redhat-8-4-amd64-sap-hana-<x>`

* SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15 SP 3 for SAP Applications (amd64) - images: `ibm-sles-15-3-amd64-sap-hana-<x>`

The provided SSH keys are used to access the SAP HANA server via SSH, as a root user. The storage volumes for SAP HANA on VSI are configured based on the [Intel Virtual Server certified profiles on VPC infrastructure for SAP HANA](/docs/sap?topic=sap-hana-iaas-offerings-profiles-intel-vs-vpc). The storage volumes for SAP HANA on Bare Metal Server are configured based on the [Bare metal servers certified profiles on VPC infrastructure for SAP HANA](/docs/sap?topic=sap-hana-iaas-offerings-profiles-intel-bm-vpc).

## Script files
{: #terraform-sap-hana-vsi-files}

The deployment automation script files are available in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/IBM-Cloud/sap-hana-db){: external}.

The scripts use the information that you provide for an existing VPC and deploy SAP HANA DB on a VSI or on a Bare Metal Server.

The Terraform scripts run the Ansible Playbooks to install the SAP architecture.

## Schematics deployment
{: #ui-sap-hana-vsi-schematics}
{: ui}

When you use the Schematics interface to deploy SAP HANA, you need to provide the following information:

* the workspace information
* the GitHub repository path
* the value for the parameters in the Schematics interface

5. Initialize the Terraform CLI.

    ``terraform init``

6.	Create a Terraform execution plan. The Terraform execution plan summarizes all the actions that are done to create the virtual private cloud instance in your account.

    ``terraform plan --out plan1``

    You are asked to enter the IBM Cloud API key and the SAP HANA main password.

    The SAP HANA main password must contain at least one digit (0-9), one lowercase letter (a-z), and one uppercase letter (A-Z). It can only contain the following characters: a-z, A-Z, 0-9, !, @, #, $, _. It must not start with a digit or an underscore ( _ ).

7. Verify that the plan shows all of the resources that you want to create and that the names and values are correct. If the plan needs to be adjusted, edit the input.auto.tfvars file to correct resources and run `terraform plan --out plan1` again.

8. Deploy the SAP solution:

    ``terraform apply "plan1"``

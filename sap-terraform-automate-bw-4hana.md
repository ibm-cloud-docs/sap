# Deploying SAP BW/4HANA on 3-tier {{site.data.keyword.cloud}} VPC (Terraform and Ansible)  
{: #bw4hana-automation-on-vpc}

## Single-host SAP HANA system
{: #bw4hana-automation-single-hana-system}

A single-host system is the simplest system installation type that runs an SAP HANA system entirely on one host. You can scale the system up as needed. The single-host system has these components:

![Figure 1. SAP NetWeaver 7.x SAP HANA single-host installation with AAS](images/sap-hana-vpc-std-pas-aas.svg "SAP NetWeaver 7.x SAP HANA standard installation with AAS"){: caption="SAP NetWeaver 7.x SAP HANA single-host installation with AAS" caption-side="bottom"}

The scripts are designed to create a new VPC and install SAP (SAP BW/4HANA release) solution together with its dedicated DB Hana box in one task flow.

## What is created
{: #bw4hana-automation-created}

The scripts work in two phases. The first phase automates the resources for the VPC provisioning process in an existing VPC created when you deployed the bastion VSI. The second phase creates the SAP architecture in a distributed environment SAP BW/4HANA App server on a distinct VSI VPC machine and SAP HANA DB on a dedicated server type VSI VPC box machine.

During the first phase, the VPC is provisioned in an existing VSI created when you deployed the bastion VSI:

* 1 VPC where the virtual server instances are provisioned.
* 1 security group. The rules for this security group allow: 
    * Inbound DNS (port 53) and
    * Inbound SSH (TCP port 22) connections to your virtual server instance.
    * All outbound traffic from the virtual server instance.
*	1 subnet to enable networking in your VPC.
*	2 X virtual server instance with SAP certified storage and network configurations.

During the second phase, the Ansible Playbook is called and the SAP architecture is installed for both dedicated VSI’s SAP App VSI machine and dedicated SAP HANA VSI box. The SAP architecture that is deployed is the SAP BW/4HANA release on stand-alone dedicated SAP HANA 2.0 box release. For more information about this architecture, see [Automating SAP HANA stand-alone virtual server instance on {{site.data.keyword.cloud}} VPC by using Terraform and Ansible](/docs/sap?topic=sap-automate-terraform-sap-hana-vsi).

## Script files
{: #bw4hana-automation-script-files}

The configuration and script files are provided in GitHub. There are two repositories for each SAP solution:

* Using the bastion server CLI to run the Terraform scripts - [GitHub repository](https://github.com/IBM-Cloud/sap-bw4hana/tree/main/cli){: external}
* Using Schematics user interface on {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} - [GitHub repository](https://github.com/ibm-cloud/sap-bw4hana/tree/main/schematics){: external}

## SAP Kits
{: #bw4hana-automation-sap-kits}

For each {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} region, IBM allocates temporary storage on a dedicated Jump host. It is your responsibility to download the necessary SAP and DB kits to your Deployment (Bastion) Server. All file archives are decompressed by Ansible during the automatic deploying process. For more information, see the readme file.

## Schematics deployment
{: #bw4hana-automation-schematics}
{: ui}

You use the Schematics interface to deploy your infrastructure with the scripts in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/ibm-cloud/sap-bw4hana/tree/main/schematics). When you run the scripts with the Schematics interface, you:

* Enter the URL for the GitHub repository for the Terraform files
* Modify the parameters in the Schematics interface. They are the same parameters as the `input.auto.tfvars` file that you use when you are running the Terraform scripts in the CLI.

## Catalog Tile deployment
{: #bw4hana-automation-single-catalog-tile}
{: ui}

When you use the Catalog Tile for deployment, you:
*   Select the **SAP BW/4HANA** tile from the catalog
*   Enter information for your workspace. The Catalog Tile creates a Schematics workspace for you.
*   Modify the parameters for your bastion server, personal credential information, and other parameters specific to your solution.

## Terraform deployment
{: #automate-bw4hana-terraform-ansible-terraform}
{: terraform}

You use the Bastion server CLI to run the Terraform scripts that are located in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/IBM-Cloud/sap-bw4hana/tree/main/cli).

To run the scripts to deploy the SAP BW/4HANA release on dedicated SAP HANA 2.0 BOX VSI, you need to:

*	The `input.auto.tfvars` file to customize the resources for your solution. 
    *  Enter the floating IP and subnet information from the Bastion server.
    *  By default, the VSI is configured with:
        * Red Hat Enterprise Linux® 8.x for SAP Applications (amd64) or Suse Enterprise Linux 15 for SAP Applications (amd64), 
        * Atleast one SSH key that is configured to access as `root` user on SSH, 
        * Five storage volumes. 

        You can change the default settings to match your solution. 

    *  You can change the default SAP system configuration settings to match your solution. 
    *  You also specify the location where you downloaded the SAP kits.

The {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Provider plug-in for Terraform on {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} uses these configuration files to provision a VPC in your {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} account.

For SAP BW/4HANA virtual server instance on {{site.data.keyword.vpc_short}}, you modify the `input.auto.tfvars` file to customize the resources for your solution. You specify zones, resource names, SSH keys, and SAP variables.

All of the other configuration files are provided and do not need to be modified.

The {{site.data.keyword.terraform-provider_full_notm}} on {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} uses these configuration files to provision a VPC in your {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} account.

## Virtual server instance configuration
{: #bw4hana-automation-vsi-config}
{: terraform}

The virtual server instance is configured with:

* Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.6 for SAP HANA (x86_64)
* Minimum one or more SSH keys that are configured to access as root user on SSH

## Before you begin
{: #bw4hana-automation-before-begin}

*	Set up your account to access the VPC. Make sure that your account is upgraded to a [paid account](/docs/account?topic=account-upgrading-account).
*   If you have not already, create a bastion server to store the SAP kits. For more information, see [Automate SAP bastion server - SAP media storage repository](/docs/sap?topic=sap-sap-bastion-server).
*	Download the SAP kits from the SAP Portal to your Deployment Server. Make note of the download locations. Ansible decompresses all of the archive kits. For more information, see the readme file. 
*  [Create or retrieve an {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} API key](/docs/account?topic=account-userapikey#create_user_key). The API key is used to authenticate with the IBM Cloud platform and to determine your permissions for IBM Cloud services.
*  [Create or retrieve your SSH key ID](/docs/ssh-keys?topic=ssh-keys-getting-started-tutorial). You need the 40-digit UUID for the SSH key, not the SSH key name.

During configuration you can specify an existing VPC to use, instead of creating a new VPC.

For the detailed steps about using Terraform to create only a VPC for SAP, see [Creating single-tier virtual private cloud for SAP by using Terraform](/docs/sap?topic=sap-create-terraform-single-tier-vpc-sap).

     * Click **Save changes**.

     For a more detailed description of each of the parameters, check the GitHub repo readme file, chapter “Input parameter file”. Also, make sure to mark the parameters that contain sensitive information like passwords, API, and ssh private keys as "sensitive". these paramters are marked as “sensitive” in the readme file, under “Input parameter file”.

7.	On the workspace Settings page, click **Generate plan**. Wait for the plan to complete.
8.	Click **View log** to review the log files of your Terraform execution plan.
9.	Apply your Terraform template by clicking **Apply plan**.
10.	Review the log file to ensure that no errors occurred during the provisioning, modification, or deletion process.

## Procedure for Terraform scripts
{: #bw4hana-automation-terraform}
{: terraform}

1.	Log in to the Deployment Server by using `ssh`.
2.	Clone the terraform and ansbile folders and readme file from https://github.com/IBM-Cloud/sap-bw4hana/tree/main

    
	    $ git clone https://github.com/IBM-Cloud/sap-bw4hana.git
    	
	    $ cd sap-bw4hana/

3.	Edit the input parameter file, `input.auto.tfvars`, and modify the variables to match your solution. The file is preset with the minimal recommended disk sizes. For using an existing VPC, you must modify:

    * VPC - An existing VPC name. By defulat, the scripts expect an existing VPC name.  
    * SECURITYGROUP - change `ic4sap` to the VPC name.
    * SUBNET - change `ic4sap` to the VPC name.
    * DB_HOSTNAME - enter a hostname up to 13 characters. For more information, see the readme file. 
    * APP_HOSTNAME - enter a hostname up to 13 characters. For more information, see the readme file. 

    Replace the SSH keys in the file with your SSH key 40-digit ID.

    ```terraform
    #General VPC variables
    REGION          = "ed-de"
    ZONE            = "eu-de-2"
    VPC             = "ic4sap"
    SECURITYGROUP   = "ic4sap-securitygroup"
    SUBNET          = "ic4sap-subnet"
    SSH_KEYS        = [ "ssh key1" , "ssh key2" ]

    # SAP Database VSI variables:
    DB_HOSTNAME     = "sapbw4db"
    DB_PROFILE      = "mx2-16x128" 
    DB_IMAGE        = "ibm-redhat-7-6-amd64-sap-hana-1" # For any manual change in the terraform code, you have to make sure that you use a certified image based on the SAP Note: 2927211.

    # SAP APPs VSI variables:
    APP_HOSTNAME    = "sapbw4app"
    APP_PROFILE     = "bx2-4x16"
    APP_IMAGE       = "ibm-redhat-7-6-amd64-sap-applications-1" # For any manual change in the terraform code, you have to make sure that you use a certified image based on the SAP Note: 2927211.

    ```

    The hostname must have up to 13 characters as required by SAP. For more information about the rules that apply to hostnames for SAP systems, see SAP Note 611361 - Hostnames of SAP ABAP Platform servers
    {: note}

4.	In the same file (`input.auto.tfvars`), edit the SAP system configuration variables that are passed to the Ansible automated deployment. 

    ```
    #SAP HANA DB configuration
    hana_sid = "BWH"
    hana_sysno = "00"
    hana_system_usage = "custom"
    hana_components = "server"

    #SAP HANA Installation kit path
    kit_saphana_file = "/storage/HANADB/51054623.ZIP"

    #SAP system configuration
    sap_sid = "BWH"
    sap_ascs_instance_number = "01"
    sap_ci_instance_number = "00"

    # Number of concurrent jobs used to load and/or extract archives to HANA Host
    hdb_concurrent_jobs = "6"

    #SAP BW4HANA APP Installation kit path
    kit_sapcar_file = "/storage/BW4HANA/SAPCAR_1010-70006178.EXE"
    kit_swpm_file = "/storage/BW4HANA/SWPM20SP09_4-80003424.SAR"
    kit_sapexe_file = "/storage/BW4HANA/SAPEXE_400-80004393.SAR"
    kit_sapexedb_file = "/storage/BW4HANA/SAPEXEDB_400-80004392.SAR"
    kit_igsexe_file = "/storage/BW4HANA/igsexe_13-80003187.sar"
    kit_igshelper_file = "/storage/BW4HANA/igshelper_17-10010245.sar"
    kit_saphotagent_file = "/storage/BW4HANA/SAPHOSTAGENT51_51-20009394.SAR"
    kit_hdbclient_file = "/storage/BW4HANA/IMDB_CLIENT20_009_28-80002082.SAR"
    kit_bw4hana_export = "/storage/BW4HANA/export"
    ```

5. Initialize the Terraform CLI. 

    ``terraform init``

6.	Create a Terraform execution plan. The Terraform execution plan summarizes all the actions that are done to create the virtual private cloud instance in your account.

    ``terraform plan``

    You must enter an SAP HANA main password and an SAP main password. 

    The SAP HANA main password must consist of at least one digit (0-9), one lowercase letter (a-z), and one uppercase letter (A-Z). It can contain only the following characters: a-z, A-Z, 0-9, !, @, #, $, _. It must not start with a digit or an underscore ( _ ). 
    
    The SAP main password must be 10 - 14 characters long and contain at least one digit (0-9). It can only contain the following characters: a-z, A-Z, 0-9, @, #, $, _. This password cannot contain `!`. It must not start with a digit or an underscore ( _ ).

7. Verify that the plan shows all of the resources that you want to create and that the names and values are correct. If the plan needs to be adjusted, edit the ``input.auto.tfvars`` file to correct resources and run ``terraform plan`` again.


8. Create the virtual private cloud for SAP instance and IAM access policy in {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}.

    ``terraform apply``

     The virtual private cloud and components are created and you see output similar to the `terraform plan` output.  

## Next steps
{: #bw4-automation-next-steps}
{: terraform}

If you need to rename your resources after they are created, modify the ``input.auto.tfvars`` file to change the names and run ``terraform plan`` and ``terraform apply`` again. Do not use the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Dashboard and user interface to modify your VPC after it is created. The Terraform scripts create a complete solution and selectively modifying resources with the user interface might cause unexpected results. 

If you need to remove your VPC, go to your project folder and run ``terraform destroy``.

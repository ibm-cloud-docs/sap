{: #iaas-offerings-summary}

The {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} SAP-Certified IaaS gives you the flexibility to run your SAP workloads in the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} when you need them, where you need them with over 60 {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} data centers worldwide. You can quickly address issues such as:
* Rapidly expanding and contracting capacity (as needed)
* Migrating SAP workloads to the cloud
* Supplementing existing on-premises virtualized infrastructure architectures.

The {{site.data.keyword.ibm_cloud_sap}} portfolio primarily consists of five offerings:
1. {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Bare Metal
2. {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Bare Metal with Intel Optane DC Persistent Memory
3. {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Virtual Servers
4. IBM Power Virtual Servers (complementary offering from {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} Power Systems, with connection through {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}})
5. {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} for VMware

More information on the Infrastructure offerings within the {{site.data.keyword.ibm_cloud_sap}} portfolio, see [Infrastructure certified for SAP](/docs/sap?topic=sap-iaas-offerings).

These offerings are spread across two primary infrastructure environments, and one separated environment that uses IBM Power technologies:
- [{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Classic Infrastructure environment](/docs/sap?topic=sap-classic-env-introduction). The original environment and network, formerly known as the Softlayer network.
- [{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} VPC Infrastructure environment](/docs/sap?topic=sap-vpc-env-introduction). The latest environment and network, with the newest technologies and networking capabilities.
- [{{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} Power Systems Infrastructure environment](/docs/sap?topic=sap-power-env-introduction). The environment maintained by {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} Power Systems built of IBM Power enterprise components, which has links to either Classic Infrastructure and VPC Infrastructure.

Our documents provide detailed considerations and information for building your SAP environments at each layer for all offerings. However, if you are interested in quickly finding the information related specifically to one of the IaaS offerings, then you may consider using the Fast Path Site Maps for [Intel Bare Metal](/docs/sap?topic=sap-fast-path-site-map-intel-bm), [Intel Virtual Servers](/docs/sap?topic=sap-fast-path-site-map-intel-vs-gen2), and [IBM Power Virtual Servers](/docs/sap?topic=sap-fast-path-site-map-power-vs) and [VMware SDDC](/docs/sap?topic=sap-fast-path-site-map-vmware-sddc).

### Certifications summary
{: #iaas-certifications-summary}

- SAP S/4HANA (AnyPremise edition), which uses SAP HANA scale-up.
- SAP BW/4HANA, which uses SAP HANA scale-up.
- SAP BW/4HANA, which uses SAP HANA scale-out.

For more details on SAP S/4HANA scale-out with IBM Cloud, read [SAP S/4HANA additional design considerations](/docs/sap?topic=sap-s4hana), which describes while this is possible, IBM-SAP prefer to discuss first to understand the business requirements. This is to avoid transactional performance issues, which may occur with SAP S/4HANA scale-out.
{: note}

## SAP's Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) offerings
{: #paas-offerings-summary}

{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} also enables the use of cloud-native SAP technologies. IBM-SAP work on multiple open source projects together and both companies use similar technology underpinnings. You can reduce your SAP implementation project timelines and long-term maintenance by adopting the "Side-by-Side Extensibility" model that SAP recommends for custom development with their SAP Business Applications.

The portfolio includes a variation of SAP's Platform-as-a-Service, which is designed for increased security of cloud-native SAP extensions. This SAP PaaS variation can be combined with {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}'s various PaaS options, functions, and services.

**Affiliate offerings for SAP's PaaS by request only:**
- SAP Cloud Platform Private Edition, using Red Hat OpenShift Virtualization

However, the core cloud-native SAP technologies are able to be used directly with Red Hat OpenShift on {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} or other {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} capabilities (such as Cloud Foundry) in the same way as deploying to SAP Cloud Platform. This is because many of the cloud-native SAP technologies are built upon widely supported cloud-native technologies. However, to deploy outside of the SAP Cloud Platform ecosystem requires general knowledge of cloud-native technologies, and will require more manual effort (not described in this documentation series) because the SAP multitarget application (MTA) archive format is not supported outside SAP Cloud Platform.

Cloud-native SAP technologies which are portable, directly to Red Hat OpenShift on {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} or Cloud Foundry from {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}, examples include:
- [SAP Fundamental Library Styles component library](https://sap.github.io/fundamental-styles){: external} for UI Frameworks (Angular, React, Vue, and other frameworks)
- [SAPUI5 Framework](https://sapui5.hana.ondemand.com){: external} (and upstream project [OpenUI5](https://openui5.org){: external})

## SAP's Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) offerings
{: #saas-offerings-summary}

{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} is also available as an option underneath SAP's Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) products.

{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} offerings for SAP's SaaS by request only:

  SAP S/4HANA Cloud SaaS, Extended Edition; using {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} SAP-certified IaaS _({{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} is a strategic premier partner, requires PMC contract with a services partner)_

## SAP Partner ecosystem solutions offerings
{: #partner-solutions-summary}

{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} provides numerous solutions from SAP's Partner ecosystem. These solutions can reduce SAP implementation project timelines or increase the efficiency of SAP Systems that are running maintenance on {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}. {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} works closely with these SAP Partners (who are also IBM Business Partners) to offer their capabilities from the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} catalog.

These solutions from SAP Patners may not apply to all SAP software or all Infrastructure within the {{site.data.keyword.ibm_cloud_sap}} portfolio; please see the individual sections under the _SAP Partner certified solutions_ topic group.

**This table summarises the available SAP Partner solutions:**

| SAP Partner | Solution name | Solution description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Veeam | [Veeam Backup & Replication for SAP HANA](https://www.veeam.com/products/applications/sap-hana-backup-recovery.html){: external} | Backint backups from SAP HANA |

## Comparing the different SAP-certified IaaS offerings
{: #iaas-offerings-compare-summary}

When you compare the different SAP-certified IaaS offerings available on {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}, keep in mind that each offering was designed to provide flexibility for various scenarios. Each offering provides different levels of performance criteria, security, and risk-acceptance.

Each of these SAP-certified offerings is available to support numerous different SAP Business or SAP Technical Applications. However they differ in the performance they can achieve:
- Bare Metal very offers high performance. This option has no software-related overheads as it is purely an OS and the SAP software that uses local SSD storage. However, the SAP workload cannot move around as easily.
- Intel Virtual Servers for VPC uses an {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} managed hypervisor. This option provides lower total cost of ownership when coupling Suspend Discounts and Sustained Usage Discounts, with more flexibility and an abundance of extra features for security and networking. However, the performance and sizing are lower than other options.
- IBM Power Virtual Servers use the enterprise-grade IBM PowerVM Type 1. This option is a complementary offering from {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} Power Systems, with connection through {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}, that provides significant scalability on robust hardware with significant flexibility and many more features available. But, this option does not allow root-access control of IBM PowerVM underneath where some SAP tools would ordinarily provide integration. **_Commonly this is paired with existing IBM Power or IBM Z infrastructure in on-premises data centers, to create a Hybrid Cloud model which drives modernization using paired capabilities from either on-premises or Cloud that address the business needs (e.g. security, flexibility, speed etc.) and business strategy_**
- VMware is a Type 2 hypervisor. This option has a minor reduction in the available performance. But this option also has vastly more flexibility and optimization in running SAP workloads, including:
 - Full root-access control to all VMware features
 - Capability to install more software that uses VMware capabilities (for example, SAP Landscape Management)
 - Ability to bridge the network with any existing VMware installations

This content is a high-level summary, for more details please see [Infrastructure certified for SAP](/docs/sap?topic=sap-iaas-offerings); in addition there are multiple pages describing each profile available across the infrastructure options.

Our recommendation is to investigate what your current business requirements are and what are your future requirements for growth. This information helps you understand the short-term and long-term needs for running your SAP Systems. After you know your short-term and long-term needs, complete an SAP Sizing exercise.

This exercise provides you with enough information to establish what IaaS and surrounding needs you might have, which can help to evaluate decision points such as:
- Whether to move the existing SAP workload to cloud quickly or steadily (for example, avoid data center expiry fees versus potential business disruption)
- Whether to migrate the existing SAP ECC system to SAP S/4HANA, or build from the ground up on the cloud.
- What your current sizings of your SAP Systems are, and their projected increases.
- How to align your move to cloud and SAP rollouts to meet business needs. For example, connectivity to existing applications in on-premises data centers, intermittent or offline locations such as factories or front-line business operators, mobile device connectivity while retaining security and more.

The following documentation sections provide details to help understand how {{site.data.keyword.ibm_cloud_sap}} can empower your business and help you to make informed decisions for your IaaS, PaaS, SaaS, and SAP Partner solution choices.

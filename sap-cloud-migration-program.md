# SAP to Cloud Migration Acceleration Program
{: #cloud-migration-acceleration-program}

SAP Business Applications continue to play a critical role for many Enterprises. IBM Cloud believes “The Best Run SAP”, and we empower those Enterprises; we put smart to work for the Enterprise.

The way that we empower SAP-run businesses, is to merge the functions of SAP business applications with the full capabilities of Cloud for the Enterprise.

We deliver these capabilities, by providing solutions to accelerate SAP implementations and run Enterprises with worldwide, on-demand, SAP-certified Infrastructure and more.

To accelerate our joint customers' success and maximize return on investment as they move SAP workloads to Cloud, **IBM Cloud provides the SAP to Cloud Migration Acceleration Program with the following promotional benefits:**

- Price discounts for all SAP-certified Infrastructure within the portfolio _(including affilitate offerings from IBM Systems)_

- Consumption-based credits of your total spend with IBM Cloud _(or complementary offerings from IBM Systems)_


These benefits are available across all IBM Business Partners and channels. Eligibility requirements for this program are amended for each local country and details are available from your local IBM Cloud sales team.

This program is our commitment to helping SAP-run Enterprises, and we work with your chosen services partners to make your journey to Cloud successful.

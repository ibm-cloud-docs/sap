## Understanding Virtual Server profile names
{: #nw-iaas-intel-vs-vpc-names}

With {{site.data.keyword.vsi_is_full}}, the profile families that are certified for SAP are: *Compute Optimized*, *Balanced*, *Memory Optimized*, *Very High Memory Optimized*, and *Ultra High Memory Optimized*.
- *Compute Optimized* family profiles provide more compute power, and they have more cores with less memory.
- *Balanced* family profiles provide a good mix of performance and scalability for more common workloads.
- All the memory family profiles cater to memory intensive workloads, such as demanding database applications and in-memory analytics workloads, and are especially designed for SAP HANA workloads.

For more information, see chapter [x86-64 instance profiles](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-profiles).


The first letter of the profile name indicates the profile family mentioned above:

| First letter | Characteristics of the related profile family |
| --- | --- |
| c | *Compute Optimized* family, vCPU to memory ratio 1:2 or 1:2.5 |
| b | *Balanced* family, vCPU to memory ratio 1:4 or 1:5 |
| m | *Memory Optimized* family, higher vCPU to memory ratio 1:8 or 1:10 |
| v | *Very High Memory Optimized*  family, very high vCPU to memory ratio 1:14 |
| u | *Ultra High Memory Optimized* family, ultra high vCPU to memory ratio 1:28 |
{: caption="{{site.data.keyword.vsi_is_full}} Profile Families" caption-side="top"}


For SAP HANA, only the memory profile families are used, for NetWeaver also the *Compute Optimized* and the *Balanced* families may be considered. The Virtual Server profile names are contextual and sequential. See here one example:

| Profile name | Naming convention component | What it means |
| --- | --- | --- |
| mx?-16x128 | m | *Memory Optimized* family |
| | x | Intel x86_64 CPU Architecture |
| | ? \n   2 \n   3 | The Intel generation for the underlying hardware \n   Cascade Lake \n   Sapphire Rapids |
| | d | the optional 'd' in the name indicates that the server is equipped with one or more internal SSD or NVMe storage devices (*) |
| | â€” | _spacer_ |
| | 16 | 16 vCPU |
| | x | _spacer_ |
| | 128 | 128 GiB RAM |
{: caption="Profile naming for SAP HANA" caption-side="top"}

(\*) Note for Virtual Server Instances using temporary local SSD or NVMe storage: you must not place any SAP workload related data on such instance storage, because data loss may occur in certain situations - see more information here: [About instance storage](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-instance-storage).

## Profiles available on Hourly Consumption Billing
{: #nw-iaas-intel-vs-vpc-hourly}

All {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} {{site.data.keyword.vsi_is_short}} are available with Hourly Consumption Billing, which includes Suspend Discounts and Sustained Usage Discounts. With Suspend Discounts, storage charges occur only if the server is in Shutdown state. With Sustained Usage Discount, the more a server is used, the less the cost per hour.


## Storage specifications
{: #nw-iaas-intel-vs-vpc-storage-specs}

When the virtual server profiles for SAP HANA are initially provisioned, the servers all have one pre-configured volume (vda) attached with the following basic layout:

| File system | Partition | Storage type | size (GB) | Nr. of\nIOPS |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `/` | `vda1` | Pre-configured boot volume | 100 | 3,000 |
| `/boot` | `vda2` | Pre-configured boot volume | 0.25 | 3,000 |
{: caption="Storage configuration of the default virtual server deployment (boot volume)" caption-side="top"}

To fulfill the size and I/O requirements for SAP NetWeaver or SAP AnyDB, more [{{site.data.keyword.block_storage_is_full}}](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-block-storage-about) volumes need to be added as data volumes to the virtual server configuration.

Block Storage Volumes for Virtual Servers can be created based on different **volume profiles** that provide different levels of IOPS per gigabyte (IOPS/GB). For more information, see [IOPS tiers](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-block-storage-profiles#tiers) for details.

You must consider the total IOPS required for your installation and the performance characteristics of your database. One option is to colocate multiple directories into a single large volume with high IOPS, versus isolating directories into individual small volumes with an insufficient number of IOPS for the workload characteristics.

For an overview of all available storage profiles, see [VPC Block Storage Profiles](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-block-storage-profiles).

For SAP NetWeaver and SAP AnyDB, a minimum of 5 IOPS/GB is recommended.

Samples of storage configurations that use Intel Virtual Server (Gen2) profiles are available under [Storage design considerations](/docs/sap?topic=sap-storage-design-considerations).

## Intel Bare Metal servers on Classic Infrastructure
{: #iaas-intel-bm}

{{site.data.keyword.baremetal_long}} are physical servers with numerous customization capabilities.

The servers are dedicated for your use, or your customer's, and not shared in any part, including server resources, with other {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} customers.

These servers are managed by the account holder, either you, your customer, or your services partner, depending on your business operations.

These servers are provisioned with your choice of operating system (OS) image that is directly installed to bare metal.

Because customization is controlled on bare metal servers, fast provisioning times of in the range 1 - 4 hours are obtainable with worldwide availability. For larger systems (greater 4 TB DRAM), there is a longer validation period for checking the hardware components (particularly RAM), but the machines are usually available within 24 hours.

### Constructs for provisioning IBM Power Virtual Servers
{: #iaas-power-vs-constructs}

As the IBM Power Virtual Server is a complementary offering from {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} Power Systems, it is accessed as an additional offering from the IBM Cloud catalog. To begin using IBM Power Virtual Servers, an instantiation of an IBM Power Virtual Server resource group must first be made.

The below sections explain this in more detail.

#### Resource versus Resource Group
{: #iaas-power-vs-constructs-resource-versus-group}

A **resource** in the context of {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} {{site.data.keyword.powerSys_notm}}s is not a user, it's anything that you can create from the catalog, for example, an {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} {{site.data.keyword.powerSys_notm}}. A **resource group** contains multiple resources, for example, a set of servers used strictly for development activities. For more information, see [Creating resources](/docs/account?topic=account-manage_resource).

#### Service versus instance
{: #iaas-power-vs-constructs-service-versus-instance}

There is difference between an {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} {{site.data.keyword.powerSys_notm}} **service** and an {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} {{site.data.keyword.powerSys_notm}} **instance**. Think of the {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} {{site.data.keyword.powerSys_notm}} **service** as a container for all {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} {{site.data.keyword.powerSys_notm}} **instances** at a specific geographic location. The {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} {{site.data.keyword.powerSys_notm}} **service** is available from the **Resource list** in the {{site.data.keyword.cloud}} UI. The service can contain multiple {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} {{site.data.keyword.powerSys_notm}} **instances**.

For example, you can have two {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} {{site.data.keyword.powerSys_notm}} **services**, one in Dallas and another in Washington DC. Each service can contain multiple {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} {{site.data.keyword.powerSys_notm}} **instances**. For more information, see [Getting started with {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} {{site.data.keyword.powerSys_notm}}](/docs/power-iaas?topic=power-iaas-getting-started).

All instances of an SAP system must run in the same service. Multiple systems can be distributed through different services, in which case IT operations teams must ensure that latency is acceptable for their scenarios.
{: note}


### IBM Power CPU type - dedicated or shared
{: #iaas-power-vs-dedicated-shared}

For **shared** processors, you choose the number of CPUs that the new server is entitled to use. This number should correspond to the number of CPUs that were the result of your sizing. The entitled CPUs should be sufficient for normal production operation and to cover workload during peak time. Don't count on additional CPUs that you might get out of the shared processor pool for uncapped processors.

For **dedicated** processors, the number of dedicated CPUs should correspond to the number of CPUs that were the result of your sizing.

For more information about shared and dedicated processors, see [Assigning the appropriate processor entitled capacity](https://www.ibm.com/support/pages/assigning-appropriate-processor-entitled-capacity) and [Power Virtual Servers processor types](/docs/power-iaas?topic=power-iaas-power-iaas-faqs#processor).

Depending on the SAP workload, supported processor options are restricted. For more information, see [SAP Note 2855850](https://me.sap.com/notes/2855850){: external}.

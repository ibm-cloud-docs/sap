An Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) environment consists primarily of compute, storage, and network components from a specified region (such as the US) and a designated site location (also referred to as zone, which is a data center site). For more information:
- [IBM Cloud VPC Infrastructure environment introduction](/docs/sap?topic=sap-vpc-env-introduction)


Certified Infrastructure-as-a-Service for SAP is available in many variations, each with different capabilities and sizes to fit many different SAP workload scenarios. For more information:
- [Infrastructure certified for SAP - Intel Bare Metal servers on VPC Infrastructure](/docs/sap?topic=sap-iaas-offerings#iaas-intel-bm-vpc)

The following is an overview of the SAP-certified profiles with IBM Intel Virtual Servers for SAP HANA and SAP NetWeaver. For more information:
- [IBM Cloud Intel Bare Metal Server certified profiles for SAP HANA](/docs/sap?topic=sap-hana-iaas-offerings-profiles-intel-bm-vpc)
- [IBM Cloud Intel Bare Metal Server certified profiles for SAP NetWeaver](/docs/sap?topic=sap-nw-iaas-offerings-profiles-intel-bm-vpc)

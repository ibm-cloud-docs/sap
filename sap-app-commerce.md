# SAP Commerce
{: #commerce}

SAP Commerce (formerly SAP Hybris Commerce) is part of the Customer Experience (CX) portfolio under the SAP C/4HANA suite.

Due to the design and business purpose and the nature of SAP Commerce, the installation, deployment, and additional development code is much more suited to a DevOps way of working. Project teams often use agile SDLC/PM methodologies (such as Scrum or SAFe). As an example of the flexibility, SAP Commerce runs across multiple different Operating Systems that are supported by SapMachine, a downstream OpenJDK release that is maintained and supported by SAP.

Therefore, deployments of SAP Commerce are available in different variants; we detail the following to assist understanding what {{site.data.keyword.ibm_cloud_sap}} can provide:

- **SAP Commerce "on-premises edition" variants:**
  - SAP Commerce "on-premises edition" with on-premises data center
  - SAP Commerce "on-premises edition" on Cloud IaaS
- **SAP Commerce Cloud (PaaS solution) variants:**
  - SAP Commerce Cloud hosted on SAP Infrastructure (also known as CCv1 using VMs)
  - SAP Commerce Cloud in the Public Cloud (also known as CCv2 using Kubernetes)

Within the {{site.data.keyword.ibm_cloud_sap}} portfolio, infrastructure is supported for **_SAP Commerce "on-premises edition" on Cloud IaaS_**.

This solution involves an installation of the SAP Commerce software onto Cloud IaaS, according to SAP installation and best practice guidance:
- [Installation and Upgrading SAP Commerce](https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_COMMERCE/a74589c3a81a4a95bf51d87258c0ab15/8bf5a611866910149242e1a3a41eb9af.html)
- [SAP Commerce Architecture](https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_COMMERCE/b490bb4e85bc42a7aa09d513d0bcb18e/8b5588d8866910149d4eb5f99c75b6b4.html)

For a typical development environment of SAP Commerce, it is straightforward (compared to other SAP software) to shut down the instantiation/s and reduce costs outside of business hours through less Cloud resource consumption; however, depending on the implementation the time to start again can be significant. This decision is required by the project team, and might not be suitable if a worldwide development team is in-place.

# Deploying SAP ASE Sybase stand-alone virtual server instance on {{site.data.keyword.cloud}} VPC
{: #automate-terraform-sap-ase-sybase-vsi}

As of 28 March 2024, the {{site.data.keyword.at_full_notm}} service is deprecated and will no longer be supported as of 30 March 2025. Customers will need to migrate to {{site.data.keyword.logs_full_notm}} before 30 March 2025. During the migration period, customers can use {{site.data.keyword.at_full_notm}} along with {{site.data.keyword.logs_full_notm}}. Activity tracking events are the same for both services. For information about migrating from {{site.data.keyword.at_full_notm}} to {{site.data.keyword.logs_full_notm}} and running the services in parallel, see [migration planning](/docs/cloud-logs?topic=cloud-logs-migration-intro).
{: important}

You can use Terraform scripts to create a VPC and SAP ASE Sybase database single VSI infrastructure in the VPC. The Terraform scripts use the information that you provide and then call the Ansible playbooks to create the SAP architecture in the specified VPC.
{: terraform}

You can use Schematics User Interface that calls Terraform scripts to create a VPC and SAP ASE Sybase database single VSI infrastructure in the VPC. The Terraform scripts use the information that you provide and then call the Ansible playbooks to create the SAP architecture in the specified VPC.
{: ui}

Terraform on {{site.data.keyword.cloud}} enables predictable and consistent provisioning of {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} VPC infrastructure resources so that you can rapidly build complex cloud environments. {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} VPC infrastructure consists of SAP certified hardware by using Intel&reg; Xeon CPUs and additional Intel&reg; technologies.
{: shortdesc}

For more information about Terraform on {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}, see [Getting started with Terraform on {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}](/docs/ibm-cloud-provider-for-terraform?topic=ibm-cloud-provider-for-terraform-getting-started).

To create resources with Terraform, you can use Terraform configuration files that describe the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} resources that you need and how you want to configure them. Based on your configuration, Terraform creates an execution plan and describes the actions that need to be run to create the resources. You can review the execution plan, change it, or run the plan.
{: terraform}

You have two deployment methods to choose from:

* In CLI, by running the Terraform script on your bastion server.
* In Schematics User Interface, which is accessed from your {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} dashboard menu.

## Prerequisites
{: #terraform-sap-ase-sybase-vsi-prerequisites}
{: terraform}

A deployment server (bastion server) deployed by using the automation solution [Automate SAP bastion server – SAP media storage repository](https://test.cloud.ibm.com/docs/sap?topic=sap-sap-bastion-server){: external}, must exist in the same VPC and same region. This should have the same subnet and security group that is configured for the SAP system VSI.

## What is created
{: #terraform-sap-ase-sybase-vsi-created}

The scripts automate the deployment of the virtual infrastructure resources and the provisioning processes for the SAP architecture in an existing VPC. An SAP ASE Sybase DB, on a VPC virtual server instance box, is provisioned. The scripts work in two phases.

During the first phase, a virtual server instance, with SAP certified storage and network configuration (the same subnet and security group as for the deployment server (bastion server)) is configured.

During the second phase, the Ansible playbooks are called and the SAP ASE Sybase 2.0 architecture is installed on the SAP ASE Sybase VSI box.

There are {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} VPC SAP certified server profiles where this solution can be deployed.

### x86-64 instance profiles
{: #terraform-sap-ase-sybase-vsi-x86-64}

During provisioning IBM Cloud® Virtual Servers for Virtual Private Cloud, you can select from the following families of profiles:

* Compute Optimized
* Balanced
* Memory Optimized
* Very High Memory Optimized
* Ultra High Memory Optimized

A profile is a combination of instance attributes, such as the number of vCPUs, amount of RAM, network bandwidth, and default bandwidth allocation. The attributes define the size and capabilities of the virtual server instance that is provisioned. In the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} console, you can select the most recently used profile or click View All Profiles tab to choose the profile that best fits your needs.

For more information about SAP profiles, see [Intel Virtual Server certified profiles on VPC infrastructure for SAP NetWeaver](/docs/sap?topic=sap-nw-iaas-offerings-profiles-intel-vs-vpc).

The Terraform scripts use the information that you provide in `input.auto.tfvars` file, call the Ansible Playbooks and deploy SAP ASE Sybase database single VSI and the SAP architecture.

## Virtual server instance configuration
{: #terraform-sap-ase-sybase-vsi-config}

The following operating systems are supported:

* Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.6 for SAP (amd64)
* Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.4 for SAP (amd64)
* SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15 SP 4 for SAP Applications (amd64)
* SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15 SP 3 for SAP Applications (amd64)

The provided SSH keys are used to access the VSI through SSH, as a root user.

## Script files
{: #terraform-sap-ase-sybase-vsi-files}

The configuration and script files are available in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/IBM-Cloud/sap-ase-db){: external}.

The `input.auto.tfvars` file allows the customization of the input parameters.

All other configuration files are provided and no modification is required.

## Schematics deployment
{: #ui-sap-ase-sybase-vsi-schematics}
{: ui}

When you are using the Schematics interface for the deployment, you need to:

* Provide the workspace information.
* Provide the GitHub repository path.
* Update the value of the parameters in the Schematics interface. The parameters are similar to the ones from `input.auto.tfvars` file, which is used in the deployment from CLI.

## Before you begin
{: #automate-ase-sybase-standalone-vsi-before}

If you don't have a deployment server (bastion server) in the same VPC, create a deployment server to store the SAP kits. For more information, see [Automate SAP bastion server - SAP media storage repository](https://test.cloud.ibm.com/docs/sap?topic=sap-sap-bastion-server){: external}.

*	Log in to your Deployment Server and verify that Terraform and Ansible are installed.
*	Download the SAP kits from the SAP Portal to your Deployment Server. Make note of the download locations. Ansible decompresses all the archive kits. For more information, see the [Readme](https://github.com/IBM-Cloud/sap-ase-db/blob/main/README.md){: external} file.
*  [Create or retrieve an {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} API key](/docs/account?topic=account-userapikey#create_user_key&interface=ui). The API key is used to authenticate with the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} platform and to determine your permissions for {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} services.
*  [Create or retrieve your SSH key ID](/docs/ssh-keys?topic=ssh-keys-getting-started-tutorial). You need the 40-digit UUID for the SSH key, not the SSH key name.

## Procedure
{: #automate-sae-sybase-standalone-vsi-procedure}
{: terraform}

1.	Log in to the Deployment Server (Bastion server) through `ssh`.
2.	Clone the GitHub repository from https://github.com/IBM-Cloud/sap-ase-db and go to the `sap-ase-db` folder.

    ```shell
	$ git clone https://github.com/IBM-Cloud/sap-ase-db.git

	$ cd sap-ase-db
    ```

3.	Customize the values for VPC variable resources according to your existing VPC data. Your options can be specified by updating `input.auto.tfvars` file. You need a 40-digit SSH key ID for the deployment. Additional SSH key IDs are optional.

    The following input variable values must be provided:

    * REGION - Region for SAP HANA server. See the [Readme](https://github.com/IBM-Cloud/sap-ase-db/blob/main/README.md){: external} file.
    * ZONE - Zone for SAP HANA server. See the [Readme](https://github.com/IBM-Cloud/sap-ase-db/blob/main/README.md){: external} file.
    * VPC - The name of an existing VPC in the specified region.
    * SECURITY_GROUP - The name of an existing security group in the same VPC.
    * RESOURCE_GROUP - The name of an existing resource group, previously created by the user.
    * SUBNET - The name of an existing subnet in the same region and zone as the VSI.
    * SSH_KEYS - A list of SSH keys UUIDs allowed to connect through SSH to the VSIs.
    * ID_RSA_FILE_PATH - existing `id_rsa` private key file path in OpenSSH format with 0600 permissions.
    * DB_HOSTNAME - The hostname of the SAP HANA server, up to 13 characters. For more information, see the [Readme](https://github.com/IBM-Cloud/sap-ase-db/blob/main/README.md){: external} file.

4. Initialize the Terraform CLI.
    `terraform init`

5. Create a Terraform execution plan. The Terraform execution plan summarizes all the actions that are done to create the virtual private cloud instance in your account.
    `terraform plan --out plan1`

    You are asked to enter the IBM Cloud API key and the SAP ASE Sybase main password.
    The SAP ASE Sybase main password must contain at least one digit (0-9), one lowercase letter (a-z), and one uppercase letter (A-Z). It can contain the following characters only: a-z, A-Z, 0-9, !, @, #, $, _. It must not start with a digit or an underscore ( _ ).

6. Verify that the plan shows all of the resources that you want to create and that the names and values are correct. If the plan needs to be adjusted, edit the input.auto.tfvars file to correct resources and run `terraform plan --out plan1` again.

7. Deploy the SAP solution.
    `terraform apply "plan1"`

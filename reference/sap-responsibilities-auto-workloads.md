Hdblcm verifies the authenticity and integrity of the software packages prior to the installation or update. For SAP HANA, follow the SAP recommendations in verifying the authenticity of the downloaded software. The SAP HANA system can be installed using the SAP HANA Database Lifecycle Manager (HDBLCM). The installation software is downloaded from outside of your network and cannot be trusted. Therefore, you should ensure that the components are authentic before starting the SAP HANA Database Lifecycle Manager (HDBLCM).
{: note}

To verify the authenticity of a HANA software SAR archive, use this command:
`/usr/sap/hostctrl/exe/SAPCAR -dVf <archive name> /usr/sap/hostctrl/exe/libsapcrypto.so`.
To verify the signature of the additional components, run `hdblcm` with the parameter `verify_signature`. For more information, see [SAP Note 2577617](https://me.sap.com/notes/2577617){: external}.

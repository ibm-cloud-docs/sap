## Creating the Veeam backup repository
{: #veeam-creating-repository}
{: step}

The next step in implementing Veeam Backup & Replication is to create repository and establishing connections to your infrastructure.
{: shortdesc}

### Setting up the backup repository
{: #veeam-setting-up-repo}
{: step}

Use the following steps to set up the Veeam repository.

1. Log in to the Veeam Backup & Replication console.
2. Select **Backup Infrastructure** > **Backup Repository** > **Add Repository**.
3. Click **Direct Attached Storage** > **Microsoft Windows server**.
4. Enter your repository's **Name**, for example, `RSL025IOPS`, **Descirption**, and click **Next**.
5. Click **Populate** and select the drive that corresponds to the attached {{site.data.keyword.blockstoragefull}}. For the example, the corresponding drive is `V:\`. Click **Next**.
6. Click **Advanced**, select **User per-VM backup files**, and click **OK**.
7. Click **Next** twice and click **Apply** to apply the settings.
8. Click **Finish** to create the repository extent, then click **No** to relocate the Veeam configuration backup location to the new repository.

To be able to store backups on a Veeam backup repository, accounts, including administrative accounts, _must_ have access permissions on the backup repository. For instructions on setting up permissions, see [Granting Permissions on Repositories](https://helpcenter.veeam.com/docs/backup/plugins/repository_permissions.html?ver=95u4){: external}
{: important}

### Creating a backup repository
{: #veeam-creating-backup-repo}
{: step}

You can now begin writing backups to the new repository. However, for maximum economy, flexibility, and scalability, it is strongly advised to create an optional scale-out backup repository. Why should you create an optional scale-out backup repository? For economy, it enables the purchase of only the {{site.data.keyword.blockstorageshort}} you need for your current deployment. As your {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} infrastructure grows, additional {{site.data.keyword.blockstorageshort}} `extents` can be purchased and added to the scale-out backup repository. You lessen your up-front costs for the Veeam solution without incurring the overhead of reconfiguring backup jobs to point to specific `extents` within the repository.

Use the following steps to create a scale-out backup repository.

1. From the Veeam Backup & Replication console, select **Scale-out Repositories** > **Add Repository**.
2. Enter a **Name** and **Description** for the scale-out repository, and click **Next**.
3. Click **Add** and select the new backup repository. Click **Apply**.

### Establishing a connection to the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Infrastructure
{: #veeam-establishing-connection-to-infrastructure}
{: step}

Now that you've created your backup repository, you need to connect the repository to the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} infrastructure. Use the following steps to establish the connection.

1. From the Veeam Backup & Replication console, select **Backup Infrastructure** > **Managed Servers** > **Add Server** > **MICROSOFT SERVER**.
2. Enter a **DNS name or IP address** and **Description** for your host VMware vSphere (ESXi) or VMware vCenter. Click **Next**.
3. Restore the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} console and go to [Menu icon ![Menu icon](../icons/icon_hamburger.svg) > **Resource List** > **Devices** and find the server you set up for Veeam Backup & Replication.
4. Copy the Username and go back to the Veeam Backup & Replication console. Paste the server username in **Credentials Username**.
5. Go back to the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} console and copy the server's Password.
6. Restore the Veeam Backup & Replication console and paste the server password in **Credentials Password**. Enter a **Description** and click **OK**.
7. Click **Connect** to the Security Warning, and click **Next**.

The server should now appear under Managed Servers.


## Submitting the initial backup job
{: #veeam-submitting-backup-job}
{: step}

Once the infrastructure and repository has been set up, you're ready to create and submit your initial backup job.
{: shortdesc}

### Before you begin
{: #veeam-initial-backup-before-you-begin}
{: step}

Be sure to have set up the correct permissions on the backup repository. For instructions on setting up permissions, see [Granting Permissions on Repositories](https://helpcenter.veeam.com/docs/backup/plugins/repository_permissions.html?ver=95u4){: external}
{: important}

### Creating the initial backup job
{: #veeam-creating-initial-backup-job}
{: step}

1. From the Veeam Backup & Replication console, select **Backup & Replication** > **Jobs** > **Backup Job**. The **New Backup Job** wizard displays.
2. Under Add Objects, select the IP address of the server you provisioned for Veeam Backup & Replication. Click **Add**,

   Add Objects will list options for the VMs to include in the backup job. Individual VMs, VM folders, VM resource pools, or entire hosts and clusters can be added to the backup job. Adding VM groups simplifies ongoing job maintenance as the Veeam backup job doesn't need to be modified in the event VMs are added or removed from the grouping entity.
   {: note}

3. Under Storage in the New Backup Job wizard, **Backup proxy** defaults to **Automatic selection**. For **Backup repository**, select the name of the scale-out proxy and click **Next**.

   You're selecting the scale-out backup repository for the job's backup storage target because by default 14 restore points (days) are maintained. These default restore points mean that if a job runs daily, two weeks worth of backups are maintained. The backup chain is constructed using _forward incremental backups_. The initial full backup is stored and only changed blocks are stored for the subsequent restore points. For more information, see [Backup Chain](https://helpcenter.veeam.com/archive/backup/95/vsphere/backup_files.html){: external}.
   {: note}

4. Click **Next** under Guest Processing.
5. Select **Daily at this time** at **8:00 AM** for your schedule.
6. Click **Apply**.
7. Click **Run the job when I click Finish** to run the initial backup job immediately. Click **Finish**.
8. Double-click the running job and select **Show Details** to see granular status information on the running backup job.
